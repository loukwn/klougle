The discoveries, which included industrial-sized agricultural fields and irrigation canals, were announced on Thursday by an alliance of US, European and Guatemalan archaeologists working with Guatemala\u2019s Mayan Heritage and Nature Foundation. The study estimates that roughly 10 million people may have lived within the Maya Lowlands, meaning that kind of massive food production might have been needed. \u201cThat is two to three times more [inhabitants] than people were saying there were,\u201d said Marcello A Canuto, a professor of anthropology at Tulane University.  Researchers used a mapping technique called Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging. It bounces pulsed laser light off the ground, revealing contours hidden by dense foliage. The images revealed that the Mayans altered the landscape in a much broader way than previously thought; in some areas, 95% of available land was cultivated.  \u201cTheir agriculture is much more intensive and therefore sustainable than we thought, and they were cultivating every inch of the land,\u201d said Francisco Estrada-Belli, a research assistant professor at Tulane University, noting the ancient Mayas partly drained swampy areas that haven\u2019t been considered worth farming since.  The extensive defensive fences, ditch-and-rampart systems and irrigation canals suggest a highly organised workforce.  \u201cThere\u2019s state involvement here, because we see large canals being dug that are re-directing natural water flows,\u201d said Thomas Garrison, assistant professor of anthropology at Ithaca College in New York.  The 810 square miles (2,100 square kilometers) of mapping done vastly expands the area that was intensively occupied by the Maya, whose culture flourished between roughly 1,000 BC and 900 AD. Their descendants still live in the region.  The mapping detected about 60,000 individual structures, including four major Mayan ceremonial centres with plazas and pyramids.  Garrison said that this year he went to the field with the Lidar data to look for one of the roads revealed. \u201cI found it, but if I had not had the Lidar and known that that\u2019s what it was, I would have walked right over it, because of how dense the jungle is.\u201d He noted that unlike some other ancient cultures, whose fields, roads and outbuildings have been destroyed by subsequent generations of farming, the jungle grew over abandoned Maya fields and structures, both hiding and preserving them. \u201cThe jungle, which has hindered us in our discovery efforts for so long, has actually worked as this great preservative tool of the impact the culture had across the landscape,\u201d noted Garrison, who worked on the project and specialises in the city of El Zotz, near Tikal. Lidar revealed a previously undetected structure between the two sites that Garrison says \u201ccan\u2019t be called anything other than a Maya fortress\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s this hilltop citadel that has these ditch and rampart systems ... when I went there, one of these things [was] nine meters tall,\u201d he noted.  In a way, the structures were hiding in plain sight. \u201cAs soon as we saw this we all felt a little sheepish,\u201d said Canuto said of the Lidar images, \u201cbecause these were things that we had been walking over all the time.\u201d  ", "title": "Scientists discover ancient Mayan city hidden under Guatemalan jungle"}
