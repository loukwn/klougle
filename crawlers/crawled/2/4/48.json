In 2017, the professor told Wired magazine that the AI \u201cgenie is out of the bottle\u201d. He was fearful that developments in artificial intelligence will give rise to \u201ca new form of life that will outperform humans\u201d. To ensure humanity\u2019s survival, the theoretical physicist thought we would have to colonise other planets and solar systems. \u201cSpreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth,\u201d he told an audience at a Norwegian science and arts festival in 2017. Hawking also had concerns about climate change, which were amplified by the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016. \u201cTrump\u2019s action [pulling out of the Paris agreement] could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250C and raining sulphuric acid,\u201d Hawking told BBC News. He also thought that should we make contact with extraterrestrials the outcome might not be positive. In 2010, he told the Discovery Channel: \u201cIf aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\u2019t turn out well for the Native Americans.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/21/professor-stephen-hawking-scientific-predictions-climate-change-alien-invasion"}
