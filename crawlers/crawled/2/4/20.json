Perfectly preserved hoofprints of wild cattle known as aurochs have recently been found at excavations a mile and a half from the Wiltshire stone circle, David Jacques, and archaeologist at the University of Buckingham, said. The 6,000-year-old prints, preserved in what appears to be a ritualistic way, are the latest in a wealth of finds made during a decade-long dig at Blick Mead, which Jacques said amounted a \u201cnational archive of British history\u201d. The tunnel, and a flyover close to the Blick Mead excavations which could also form part of the roadworks to improve the A303, could irrevocably damage the site, he said. The government has backed plans to build a tunnel to house the A303 as it passes Stonehenge as part of measures to ease congestion and improve the setting of the neolithic site. Opponents say the plans, which include eastern and western entrances to the tunnel within the world heritage site and a possible flyover at the Countess roundabout near Amesbury, could harm the rich archaeological landscape. Jacques said impacts on the Blick Mead site had not been assessed, despite it being the only place in Britain that can trace people living there since the end of the Ice Age, around 8,000 BC. He also accused the government and Highways England of \u201cnegligence or worse\u201d for a map of the plans which he said put Blick Mead in the wrong place. He fears construction work would lower the water table, drying out the peat and silt that preserve archaeological remains. The auroch prints uncovered during the most recent excavation were preserved under a stone surface, suggesting their conservation was deliberate. Carbon dating reveals they are more than 6,000 years old. Jacques said there was a real potential that human footprints could be discovered at the site, which has previously revealed a home and signs of feasting and other human settlement.  \u201cEssentially the place is like a national archive for organic material which are like documents. It would be like destroying a unique library,\u201d he said. Jacques said the auroch hoof prints suggested that a \u201ccattle cult\u201d was operating on Salisbury Plain 6,000 years ago. \u201cWe believe they were carrying out rituals involving cattle; they were worshipping cattle. A 30ft long flint surface was built over the prints, which suggests they were deliberately preserved.\u201d Another fascinating feature is that artefacts found hinted that hunter-gatherers and and the earliest farmers were interacting together. \u201cSo actually there\u2019s a multi-cultural start-up at Stonehenge, a multi-cultural phenomenon. There was contact between hunter-gatherers and farmers. Families might have come out of that contact. It\u2019s really important for the history of Britain, not just Stonehenge.\u201d Jacques said his team\u2019s investigations of this particular aspect had only just begun. \u201cWe\u2019ve only investigated a section 80cm wide. It\u2019s likely there\u2019s lots of really important preserved stuff that will unlock stories.\u201d He argued that precious history and heritage could be lost forever if the road plans go ahead. \u201cThe intention is that an 8m high flyover will be built next to the site. One of trenches is only 2m away from the road. They seem prepared to carry on no matter what. \u201cI think the whole area should be turned into a national park and preserved for future generations and studied in perpetuity. When technology gets better there will be even more of a change to nail these stories. \u201cIt\u2019s supreme arrogance to think we know it all now and it\u2019s a scandal that this is being rushed through..\u201d David Bullock, a project manager for Highways England, said: \u201cThe document in question is a land ownership boundary plan. The plan shows indicative general features and was never intended as a geographical map. \u201cWe have just announced the start of statutory consultation on the A303 Stonehenge scheme and we welcome feedback from all interested parties during this process. \u201cConsultation will start on Thursday 8 February, which will provide an opportunity for everyone to give their views on our proposals and we would like as much feedback as possible. \u201cThis will help us to make sure we have got the best scheme, or highlight where we still need to make changes, before we make our application to build the scheme.\u201d ", "title": "Stonehenge tunnel could destroy 'unique library' of early history"}
