{"title": "Starwatch: moonlight bright enough to hunt by", "description": "<p>This week\u2019s full moon is the hunter\u2019s moon, giving light autumn evenings to hunters keen to stock up the larder for winter</p><p>This month\u2019s full moon occurs on 24 October. It is the second full moon since the autumnal equinox, and is known as the hunter\u2019s moon. It follows late September\u2019s full moon, called the harvest moon. It is said that the light from the harvest and hunter\u2019s moons is used to gather in the crops and then hunt wildlife in preparation for winter. In North America, the hunter\u2019s moon appellation is credited to the Native American people. In England, it is credited to country folk, and was first documented in the early 18th century. These two moons are particularly noticeable because they rise earlier than average night after night. Throughout the year, the moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. However, in the northern hemisphere in the autumn, the Moon rises just 30 minutes later on successive evenings, so the moonlight makes these autumn evenings lighter than normal. Allowing farmers and hunters to go about their jobs more easily. In the southern hemisphere, the Moon appears to rise later than average at this time of year. The situation is then reversed six months later. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/21/starwatch-moonlight-bright-enough-to-hunt-by\">Continue reading...</a>", "content": " This month\u2019s full moon occurs on 24 October.
