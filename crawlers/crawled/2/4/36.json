Now Jonathan \u2013 who communicates via a spelling board with the help of a facilitator who carefully watches the movement of his eyes \u2013 is campaigning for other severely disabled children to be taken out of special educational needs classes and taught in regular classes, just as he is. Jonathan has been disabled since birth, when doctors warned that he had suffered such severe brain damage (as Jonathan\u2019s Guardian article last year explained, \u201cthe MRI scan of my brain was one of the worst the technician had seen\u201d) that he may never be able to run, walk or even recognise his parents. With such a bleak prognosis, the progress Jonathan appears to have made is truly remarkable \u2013 \u201cnothing short of a miracle\u201d, as his parents describe it. Jonathan\u2019s apparent ability to communicate far beyond what was ever predicted for him \u2013 even outlining his nuanced take on the EU referendum (\u201cIt\u2019s time to pull together\u201d) in the Daily Mail in 2016 when he was just ten \u2013 led to the start of the Teach Us Too campaign, which has such support that Jonathan has presented at Augmentative and Alternative Communication conferences and has even met with MPs to lobby for educational changes. Jonathan\u2019s online petition has more than 220,000 signatures. As the media coverage and Jonathan\u2019s blog has stressed, he is an example of what patients who are apparently \u201clocked-in\u201d \u2013 fully cogent but unable to communicate \u2013 are capable of achieving. Jonathan isn\u2019t the first locked-in patient whose communicative abilities have astonished the media: in 2006, Rom Houben was hailed by Belgian neurologist Steven Laureys for his ability to type out his thoughts on a keypad \u2013 via the help of his facilitator, Linda Wouters \u2013 despite having been in a coma for 23 years and assumed to be non-communicative. Wouters interpreted subtle movements from Houben\u2019s right hand to guide his fingers to the desired letters, in a case that garnered international attention. Shortly after his story was published, concerns were raised over this method of communication: videos of messages being typed showed Wouters deftly and quickly moving Houben\u2019s hand around his keypad, apparently following the subtle indications of the locked-in patient \u2013 crucially, even when the patient was not looking at the keypad. Psychologists familiar with attempts to reach noncommunicative patients recognised Houben\u2019s case for what it was: facilitated communication. Facilitated communication (FC) is a method for assisting a nonverbal person in communicating, where a facilitator is guided to choices of letters or words via small physical signals from a patient. The technique rose to prominence during the 1980s, but subsequent controlled testing reliably demonstrated that subjects were unable to produce information that had been shown only to them. In short, the messages were coming not from the patients, but from the facilitators who were \u201cinterpreting\u201d which letter or word was being indicated.  Perhaps most importantly of all, FC can be done entirely accidentally, with no need for malice or harmful intent \u2013 often good intentions and the deep desire for contact leads the facilitator to spell out the messages themselves without even realising, convincing themselves that they were led to a letter or word by the subject in much the same way that users of dowsing rods convince themselves that their tools are leading them to water. It\u2019s all too easy to dismiss FC as harmless \u2013 after all, if it works, a previously uncommunicative person is able to share their thoughts and connect with the world; if it doesn\u2019t, a family gets a connection (albeit a false connection) to someone they love but feared they\u2019d never hear from again. However, as with many superficially harmless pseudosciences, there are case studies that stress the need for caution and reflection, including dozens of extremely troubling examples in which allegations of physical and sexual abuse have been made, based solely on reports gained via FC. Few things could be more distressing than the thought of being genuinely locked-in \u2013 cogent but unable to communicate \u2013 and forced to watch helplessly as you\u2019re effectively used as a human Ouija board, spelling out a message that falsely accuses your loved ones of terrible and utterly fictional crimes. In Houben\u2019s case, when concerns were raised regarding the veracity of his messages, independent tests were carried out: Houben was shown a range of objects and asked to name them. When Houben was unable to name any of the objects shown to him when Wouters had not been in the room, Laureys accepted that Houben had not been responsible for any of the messages, and conceded that FC \u2013 in all its flawed promise and false hope \u2013 was responsible for Houben\u2019s apparent cogency.  Once you are familiar with FC, it\u2019s very hard to look at Jonathan Bryan\u2019s remarkable progress and not ask some questions. I sincerely hope Jonathan\u2019s case is different from others in the past , and that his ability to outperform children almost twice his age at maths merely shows his enthusiasm for learning. I also hope that, despite his young age and relatively recent literacy, that he is genuinely able to write the kind of prose, littered with alliteration and assonance, that most adults could not achieve. Unfortunately, this eloquence and fluency \u2013 termed \u201cunexpected literacy\u201d in the scientific literature \u2013 is one of the red flags for FC: if the communication is actually coming not from an 11-year-old child but unintentionally from the adult charged with interpreting his messages, that literacy and numeracy becomes far less remarkable. There are, unfortunately, other red flags that are hard to ignore. Video footage of Jonathan and his spelling board shows his facilitator nimbly identifying letters at speed, even when Jonathan appears to be looking elsewhere. Of course, without first-hand experience, we should not rule out that his facilitator has such experience of working with Jonathan that she is able to read these movements accurately. But the involvement of a human interpreter inevitably introduces the possibility of accidental bias, and the kind of issues we\u2019ve seen before with FC. Those concerns are hard to dismiss, without independent testing and verification. In much of the media reporting of Jonathan\u2019s story, his spelling board is compared to that used by Stephen Hawking \u2013 whose own nonverbal condition is the result of a degenerative disease that has progressively paralysed him since he first experienced symptoms as an undergraduate at Cambridge. Today, Hawking uses eye-gaze technology \u2013 a system that monitors and accurately reacts to subtle movements of the eyes \u2013 rather than a manual spelling board. Jonathan has tried to use the same technology, to no avail, as he explained to the Guardian: \u201cIt was frustrating because the computer couldn\u2019t read my eyes very well, but my mother and carers could.\u201d In fact, as The Times reported: \u201cWhen [his mother] offered him new \u2018eye-gaze\u2019 technology for communicating he didn\u2019t like it and said: \u2018Chuck it out the window.\u2019 It may legitimately be the case that Jonathan didn\u2019t like the new technology and preferred to work with his communicator \u2013 but, sadly, there is another less hopeful explanation for the failure of the eye-gaze system. If Jonathan\u2019s messages were actually the result of FC, as prone to accidental bias and unintentional human influence as it is, an accurate eye-tracking technology would remove that bias and offer a true reflection of Jonathan\u2019s ability to communicate, or lack of such ability. It is important to stress that I haven\u2019t met Jonathan, his parents, or his facilitator \u2013 it might be that they have already carried out the kind of simple, careful tests that would ascertain for sure that the messages being written are coming directly from Jonathan. I sincerely hope so, and that Jonathan genuinely is the smart, thoughtful, astonishingly mature young boy he seems to be in his writing. I wish nothing but the best of health to him, and whatever level of academic ability he has, it\u2019s clear he has a family who love him deeply. However, before any decisions are made to move children out of their special educational needs classes and into classes where they will get less tailored support, and to fundamentally change the way we care for severely disabled children, it\u2019s vital that the methods of communication that justify these changes are thoroughly, independently and unbiasedly tested, and proven to be accurate. It\u2019s hard to ask tough questions when you so badly want something to be true, but it\u2019s even harder to find out that you\u2019ve caused inadvertent harm to vulnerable children, simply because those questions were never asked.
