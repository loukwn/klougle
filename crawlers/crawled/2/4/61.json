The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, can be used to easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost efficiency, scientists say. Fibre optic cables use pulses of light to transmit information, but currently information can only be stored through the colour of the light, and whether the wave is horizontal or vertical. By twisting light into a spiral, engineers effectively create a third dimension for light to carry information: the level of orbital angular momentum, or spin. \u201cIt\u2019s like DNA, if you look at the double helix spiral,\u201d said Min Gu from RMIT University. \u201cThe more you can use angular momentum the more information you can carry.\u201d Researchers in the US had previously created a fibre that could twist light, but Gu\u2019s team is the first to create a reasonable-size detector that can read the information it holds. Previous detectors were \u201cthe size of a dining table\u201d, but the new detector is the width of a human hair. \u201cWe could produce the first chip that could detect this twisting and display it for mobile application,\u201d Gu said. The technology could be used to upgrade fibre optic networks like Australia\u2019s national broadband network \u2013 although controversy still dogs the decision to reduce the scheme\u2019s use of fibre optics in favour of copper wire. NBN Co is on schedule to complete the network by 2020. However, the rollout represents a downgrade on the initial plan \u2013 put forward by Labor \u2013 that would have installed fibre optic cables directly into homes (known as fibre to the premises). Instead, many households have received fibre to the node \u2013 which is cheaper but produces slower speeds. For fibre to the node, optic fibre cable only runs as far as a central point in the neighbourhood, and copper wire connects that node to each home. Original ADSL connections use an average of 2.5km of copper wire per connection, fibre to the node uses 500 metres, fibre to the curb uses 30 metres, and fibre-to-the-premises uses none. In January, NBN Co admitted that three out of four customers with fibre-to-the-node would not be able to access the NBN\u2019s top speed tier. The CEO, Stephen Rue, revealed plans to increase the number of premises with fibre to the curb, which uses less copper than fibre-to-the-node. Gu said his new research could still work with networks with large amounts of copper wire. \u201cWe will definitely reduce this hurdle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make this transfer more efficient.\u201d However, because the new cables are required to effectively twist light, any upgrade could involve replacing existing fibre networks. By 2020, NBN Co estimates that 4.6m homes will have fibre to the node, 1.4m will have fibre to the curb, and 2m will have fibre to the premises. A spokesman said the network was \u201cprepared for future demand\u201d, but advances like those demonstrated at RMIT would need further acceptance before they were operationally ready. \u201cNew communications technologies are continually being tested in labs many years in advance of being commercialised. They require widespread acceptance from equipment manufacturers and network operators before they are ready for operational deployment.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/twisted-fibre-optic-light-breakthrough-could-make-internet-100-times-faster"}
