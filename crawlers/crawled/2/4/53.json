They will be able to honour, on Halloween, the hunt for dark matter, the mysterious, invisible material that is thought to permeate space and hold galaxies together. Across Britain, the US and Europe, talks, demonstrations and parties highlighting this great astronomical search will be held on 31 October \u2013 which has been designated Dark Matter Day by scientists who are seeking to discover the make-up of this elusive material. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could pick a better date to celebrate a hunt for something that is as ephemeral and mysterious as dark matter,\u201d said physicist Chamkaur Ghag, of University College London. \u201cWe can see its effects, but cannot detect it directly. It is the ultimate in ghostly phenomena.\u201d The existence of dark matter has become one of the most controversial and frustrating issues in modern physics. Its existence is inferred from the behaviour of galaxies that appear to rotate too quickly to hold themselves together. Vast haloes of material that cannot be detected by traditional methods must be surrounding galaxies and are holding them together, say astronomers. These are believed to be made up of weakly interacting massive particles \u2013 \u201cWimps\u201d \u2013 the main constituents of dark matter. These galactic haloes are vast, say scientists, and account for about 85% of the universe\u2019s total mass. Only the small remaining fraction is actually made of protons, neutrons, and atoms from which galaxies, stars, planets and living beings are constructed. \u201cEver since Copernicus, we have known we are not located anywhere special in the universe,\u201d said astronomer royal Martin Rees. \u201cBut now it transpires we are not even made of the dominant stuff in the cosmos. Most of it is made up of material from the dark side, the side we cannot yet see.\u201d It is issues like these that have led scientists to promote the idea of Dark Matter Day. As they point out, if there was no dark matter there would be nothing to hold galaxies together. There would have been no stars, no planets \u2013 no life. \u201cThat\u2019s why dark matter is so important,\u201d said Ghag. Two key ways have been developed to try to observe dark matter. First, researchers are trying to spot Wimps as they are created in the Large Hadron Collider at the headquarters of Cern in Geneva. Just as the Higgs boson appeared from particle collisions in the LHC, so a Wimp could be blasted into existence inside the collider, they argue. The other main method has involved building detectors, deep underground \u2013 often in old mines \u2013 where they are protected from the bombardment of particles that rain down on Earth\u2019s surface. These detectors contain chambers filled with tonnes of xenon gas and hundreds of light detectors. Should a Wimp \u2013 drifting through space \u2013 strike a gas particle it might release light that will indicate its presence. At least that is the hope. In fact, after 20 years of searching \u2013 and the investment of tens of millions of pounds \u2013 not a single Wimp has ever been detected, either at Cern or in underground detectors built in Britain, Europe and the US. \u201cSo far we have found absolutely nothing that fits the bill,\u201d admitted Professor Ofer Lahav, of University College London. \u201cNevertheless I would say 99% of physicists would still say they believe Wimps exist.\u201d This point was backed by Ghag. \u201cIt is frustrating not to have found dark matter after all this effort. The trouble is that we have absolutely no idea how big Wimps are. They could be the size of a hydrogen atom or they could be absolutely tiny by subatomic standards. Or they could come in lots of different sizes. That affects the kind of instruments we need to detect them.\u201d A final understanding of the nature of dark matter could be revolutionary Nor was the absence of corroborating evidence for dark matter unusual, Lahav stressed. \u201cIn the 19th century astronomers discovered major aberrations in the orbit of Uranus but solved the puzzle when they realised another planet must be disturbing it. That led to the discovery of Neptune. Then disturbances in the orbit of Mercury were discovered. This time the explanation had to wait until Einstein published his general theory of relativity in the 20th century. \u201cSo a final understanding of the nature of dark matter could be a relatively straightforward one, as in the case of Neptune, or something that is revolutionary, like the theory of relativity,\u201d added Lahav. In this latter category, some scientists now argue that it is the nature of gravity that is not understood properly and that the odd rotation of galaxies could be explained by re-evaluating Newtonian physics. Dark matter simply does not exist, say these scientific apostates. Most researchers disagree, however. They still believe dark matter is the only viable contender as an explanation for the behaviour of galaxies. \u201cOf course, at the end of the day we might find that dark matter is made up of Wimps, but that these particles simply will not interact with any kind of normal matter,\u201d said Ghag. \u201cThat means we will only be able to observe the stuff through its gravitational influences. In a sense it would then indeed be a ghost to us, unseen and only observable through its vague, distant influences.\u201d Last century scientists expected to find that stars rotated more slowly around a galaxy the more distant they were from its centre, just as distant planets revolve more slowly around the sun. However, astronomers discovered that stars at a galaxy\u2019s edge orbit almost as fast as those near its centre. So what was providing the extra gravitational force that was holding galaxies together? Theorists came up with the idea that invisible dark matter must be providing the mass that gives galaxies their gravitational force, which has since been born out by other observations. \u201cPhenomena known as gravitational lenses, as well as studies of the cosmic background radiation, provide further convincing support for the existence of dark matter,\u201d says Professor Lahav.  As for the nature of that dark matter, several candidates were put foward. These included suggestions that burnt-out stars and also clouds of dust and gas were holding galaxies together. These ideas are now dismissed, however, and weakly interacting massive particles remain the main explanation for dark matter.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/20/dark-matter-day-scientists-hunt-ghost-particle"}
