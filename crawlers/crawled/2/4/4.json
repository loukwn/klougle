But this isn\u2019t a human cry \u2013 it\u2019s the voice of a killer whale called Wikie. New research reveals that orcas are able to imitate human speech, in some cases at the first attempt, saying words such as \u201chello\u201d, \u201cone, two\u201d and \u201cbye bye\u201d. The study also shows that the creatures are able to copy unfamiliar sounds produced by other orcas \u2013 including a sound similar to blowing a raspberry. Scientists say the discovery helps to shed light on how different pods of wild killer whales have ended up with distinct dialects, adding weight to the idea that they are the result of imitation between orcas. The creatures are already known for their ability to copy the movements of other orcas, with some reports suggesting they can also mimic the sounds of bottlenose dolphins and sea lions. \u201cWe wanted to see how flexible a killer whale can be in copying sounds,\u201d said Josep Call, professor in evolutionary origins of mind at the University of St Andrews and a co-author of the study. \u201cWe thought what would be really convincing is to present them with something that is not in their repertoire \u2013 and in this case \u2018hello\u2019 [is] not what a killer whale would say.\u201d Wikie is not the first animal to have managed the feat of producing human sounds: dolphins, elephants, parrots, orangutans and even beluga whales have all been captured mimicking our utterances, although they use a range of physical mechanisms to us to do so. Noc, the beluga whale, made novel use of his nasal cavities, while Koshik, an Indian elephant jammed his trunk in his mouth, resulting in the pronouncement of Korean words ranging from \u201chello\u201d to \u201csit down\u201d and \u201cno\u201d.  But researchers say only a fraction of the animal kingdom can mimic human speech, with brain pathways and vocal apparatus both thought to determine whether it is possible. \u201cThat is what makes it even more impressive \u2013 even though the morphology [of orcas] is so different, they can still produce a sound that comes close to what another species, in this case us, can produce,\u201d said Call. He poured cold water, however, on the idea that orcas might understand the words they mimic. \u201cWe have no evidence that they understand what their \u2018hello\u2019 stands for,\u201d he said. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, researchers from institutions in Germany, UK, Spain and Chile, describe how they carried out the latest research with Wikie, a 14-year-old female orca living in an aquarium in France. She had previously been trained to copy actions performed by another orca when given a human gesture. After first brushing up Wikie\u2019s grasp of the \u201ccopy\u201d command, she was trained to parrot three familiar orca sounds made by her three-year old calf Moana.  Wikie was then additionally exposed to five orca sounds she had never heard before, including noises resembling a creaking door and the blowing a raspberry. Finally, Wikie was exposed to a human making three of the orca sounds, as well as six human sounds, including \u201chello\u201d, \u201cAmy\u201d, \u201cah ha\u201d, \u201cone, two\u201d and \u201cbye bye\u201d. \u201cYou cannot pick a word that is very complicated because then I think you are asking too much \u2013 we wanted things that were short but were also distinctive,\u201d said Call. Throughout the study, Wikie\u2019s success was first judged by her two trainers and then confirmed from recordings by six independent adjudicators who compared them to the original sound, without knowing which was which. The team found that Wikie was often quickly able to copy the sounds, whether from an orca or a human, with all of the novel noises mimicked within 17 trials. What\u2019s more, two human utterances and all of the human-produced orca sounds were managed on the first attempt \u2013 although only one human sound \u2013 \u201chello\u201d \u2013 was correctly produced more than 50% of the time on subsequent trials. The matching was further backed up through an analysis of various acoustic features from the recordings of Wikie\u2019s sounds.  While the sounds were all made and copied when the animals\u2019 heads were out of the water, Call said the study shed light on orca behaviour. \u201cI think here we have the first evidence that killer whales may be learning sounds by vocal imitation, and this is something that could be the basis of the dialects we observe in the wild \u2013 it is plausible,\u201d said Call, noting that to further test the idea, trials would have to be carried out with wild orcas.  Diana Reiss, an expert in dolphin communication and professor of psychology at Hunter College, City University of New York, welcomed the research, noting that it extends our understanding of orcas\u2019 vocal abilities, with Wikie able to apply a \u201ccopy\u201d command learned for imitation of actions to imitation of sounds. Dr Irene Pepperberg, an expert in parrot cognition at Harvard University, also described the study as exciting, but said: \u201cA stronger test would have been whether the various sounds produced could be correctly classified by humans without the models present for comparison.\u201d", "title": "Orcas can imitate human speech, research reveals"}
