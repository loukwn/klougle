Research suggests women have a better developed sense of smell and men are more visually stimulated, so men would be more likely to experience stress reduction through seeing their partner\u2019s clothing.\u201d He adds: \u201cHow close a woman feels towards her male partner \u2013 how much oxytocin she experiences when she\u2019s with them or how happy she is in the relationship \u2013 will also affect how comforting she finds smelling the clothing.\u201d What about the woman in Bristol who has offered \u00a315,000 to a designer who could make a replica of her dead mother\u2019s wedding dress from 1953 \u2013 also incorporating in the creation some of her mother\u2019s hair as a \u201cspecial memento\u201d? She began collecting the hair four years before her mother died. \u201cThis sounds like it\u2019s taking the idea of something old and borrowed to an extreme, that might be considered macabre, but perhaps for this woman it\u2019s part of something constructive [a grieving process],\u201d says psychotherapist Toby Ingham. \u201cSmells can be tremendously powerful and momentarily interrupt the chain of associations and experiences that make up the stress. They seem to operate a particular kind of hotwire to our store of feelings and memories.\u201d But before you start stockpiling your loved ones\u2019 dirty clothing (or pulling hairs out of their head), consider a simple phone call. Research from Stanford University School of Medicine found that children were immediately soothed by hearing their mother\u2019s voice, while an earlier study of teenagers found that just hearing their mother\u2019s voice can release oxytocin, the happy hormone.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/oct/24/why-sniffing-your-partners-used-clothing-could-make-you-happier"}
