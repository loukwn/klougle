For the first time, more men are dying of prostate cancer than women are from breast cancer. Any GP surgery will offer a blood test to check a man\u2019s prostate-specific antigen (PSA) indicating cancer. All men have to do is ask. The trouble is that, as we all know, men are from Mars. They don\u2019t go to GPs, don\u2019t talk about illness and believe in their own invincibility. Men with their compartmentalised brains are inherently greater risk-takers and believe they will beat the odds. In any case, to concede the threat of illness is an acknowledgement of weakness \u2013 very unmasculine. Empathising women from Venus, with their different brain structures that encourage talking and discussing issues, are more keenly aware of the risks. One of the reasons death from breast cancer is declining is because women, better understanding the risks, demand action as an NHS priority \u2013 and then act on what is offered. No parallel demand is coming from men. It is just one more piece of evidence that men and women are supposedly hardwired to think and behave differently \u2013 and on this occasion men are the losers. Men\u2019s brains are more segmented, runs the argument, and their thinking is concentrated and focused in the right hemisphere of the brain given over to calculus and reasoning. By contrast, the story continues, women\u2019s left and right brain hemispheres are more interconnected, with much more traffic in the cerebral cortex. These \u201cspaghetti\u201d brain structures are hardwired to link the creative and emotional dimensions of the brain with its rational thinking element, enhancing women\u2019s linguistic and empathetic capabilities, helping them better understand people. They feel more, crucial when nurturing the young and shaping communities in the human evolutionary story. Men intrinsically are better at mathematics and building dams; women are intrinsically better at English and building homes. Thus the pattern of different income, employment and opportunity for women, indeed, day-to-day interaction, does not flow from prejudice and male sexism, although both are inexcusable and must be stamped on. Women\u2019s lower lifetime earnings for similar jobs, the fact that they hold fewer top jobs, the time they spend on child rearing and in the home, and their tendency to avoid science and technology are not because of sexism \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 but because they are different. But what if the whole intellectual edifice supporting these claims were wrong? Enter the scientist Cordelia Fine, whose Testosterone Rex, winner of the 2017 Royal Society prize for popular science writing, convincingly debunks the entire\u00a0thesis. For every study demonstrating the hypothesis that women\u2019s brains are less compartmentalised than men\u2019s, there is another knocking it down. There is no conclusive evidence that there is more traffic in women\u2019s cerebral cortexes; no evidence that testosterone starts to separate out boys\u2019 brain hemispheres in the womb; no evidence that more highly compartmentalised brains allow more system thinking and no evidence that the resulting shorter brain circuits mean better brains. It is bunkum, from top to bottom, she argues, a form of \u201cneurosexism\u201d. The greater truth is that we hardly understand what is going on in the brain. Instead, science is being infected by sexist stereotyping of men and women, causing categories and inferences to be invented that don\u2019t exist \u2013 and justify women\u2019s continued subordination. Fine\u2019s critics \u2013 and she has a few \u2013 accuse her feminism of trumping her science. For example, evolutionary theory, which she does not contest, is built on the truth of sexual selection established by Darwin: the species has to be reproduced and advanced by coupling between the two genders. That in turn means the winning of mates and achieving arousal by being attractive to each other. The nature of the attraction is complex and elusive, but it does imply basic gender behaviours that are different. Moreover, if male and female brains are as identical as Fine suggests, how come autism is vastly more a male disease and the distribution of both genius and idiocy is more pronounced in men than women? But even the toughest critics concede she is right to push back on the role of testosterone, its influence on brain function and the allegedly deep neural differences between men and women. The science, they agree, does not back any of it. Reading and listening to Fine, I would go further \u2013 the science abounds in neurosexism. Nor does selection theory challenge her position. It is perfectly possible for men and women\u2019s brains to work identically with equal power \u2013 perhaps men are not from Mars nor women from Venus, but from the same planet after all \u2013 even while they behave in ways to attract each other, as Darwin would predict. What is driving men\u2019s mortality rate from prostate cancer is not masculine brain structures \u2013 it\u2019s the NHS spending half as much money on communication and treatment as it does for breast cancer. A century ago, scientists warned that winning the vote would put such neurological pressure on the challenged female brain there would be a 25% rise in female insanity. Today, surely, we can see parallel statements for what they are: pernicious sexism. The Chinese proverb is right: men and women hold up the sky equally. It\u2019s time for everyone to act on that fundamental\u00a0truth.", "title": "So men are dying because they don\u2019t have women\u2019s brains? Show me the evidence"}
