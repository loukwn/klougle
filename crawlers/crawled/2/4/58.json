The letter, signed by 29 Nobel prizewinners and six Fields medallists, says the UK \u201cmust now strive to ensure that as little harm as possible is done to research\u201d. Among the signatories was Sir Paul Nurse, the British geneticist who won his Nobel for pioneering work on cancer therapy and tumour diagnosis, and the biologist Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society. \u201cThe increasing chaos \u2013 because that\u2019s what it looks like \u2013 around the Brexit negotiations is causing huge concern among scientists,\u201d Nurse told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t seem to be putting this at the top of its agenda. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how depressed our young scientists are about the messages coming out of government. This is just awful. You are letting your extremists dominate the debate. You have to get a grip on them.\u201d A survey of more than 1,000 staff at the Crick Institute, the biggest biomedical research lab in Europe, found 97% of them believed a hard Brexit would be bad for UK science and 82% thought it would have a detrimental effect on European science. The science minister, Sam Gyimah, said the government was making preparations to protect collaboration in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe all recognise that a chaotic Brexit will be a significant setback for science,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we have got a plan to ensure that, deal or no deal, there will be no cliff-edge for UK science.\u201d Gyimah said there were \u201cunprecedented amounts of money going into UK science \u2013 \u00a37bn in the next five years \u2013 that is more than we have ever invested in research and development\u201d. However, Nurse said that would not directly replace the \u00a31bn in EU funding that could be lost. \u201cThe \u00a37bn \u2026 will bring us up from being up from the bottom of the G7 nations, to somewhere in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this cut, of up to \u00a31bn, will significantly erode that.\u201d Nurse said there were also significant concerns about the mobility of scientists, and present visa arrangements for non-EU countries were inhibiting cooperation. \u201cWe are increasing the difficulties of getting people into the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister frankly does not have a positive view about immigration \u2013 that\u2019s her main driver. We cannot feel confident that problem is going to be solved.\u201d Gyimah said May had made it clear the UK wanted to continue to associate with EU programmes after Brexit, but there would be some changes. \u201cWe are leaving the EU and the nature of our arrangements in science will, in all honesty, change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have significant assets to bring to the table as far as the EU is concerned, world-class universities, top scientists, so we are in a position to have a win-win deal. The mobility of scientists is a key part of what we will agree with the EU in the future economic partnership.\u201d The letter from the scientists came amid warnings that emergency powers may be needed to ensure patients can still get the medicines they need after a no-deal Brexit. The Healthcare Distribution Association said 50% of medicines in a typical wholesaler\u2019s warehouse had been through the EU at some point. Martin Sawer, the HDA\u2019s executive director, who is due to give evidence to MPs on Tuesday, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cA no-deal, we believe, would require some sort of temporary emergency powers to ensure consistent supply to patients in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem about aligning regulations to start with. That creates an ease of transport. It\u2019s also a logistics issue about all the transport infrastructure being tied up in Calais, trying to get into France, that we need to get back here.\u201d It could take \u201cmonths or years\u201d for alternative supply routes to be established, he said. \u201cWe believe, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would be shortages and effects to that commodity system that we can\u2019t foresee,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so, because of an uncertain future, we can\u2019t yet plan for what a no-deal would look like.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/23/hard-brexit-cripple-uk-science-nobel-scientists-may-juncker"}
