Chloe Warren \n\nMon 29 Jan 2018 16.12\u00a0GMT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 31 Jan 2018 11.38\u00a0GMT\n\n In an ideal world, academic scientists would work together towards a common goal: discovery. Researchers would unite for a common cause, motivated by boundless curiosity, working selflessly towards the Greater Good.  While the pursuit of knowledge may be a noble thing, it\u2019s not actually that different from any other occupation, in that it requires a salary. Many scientists must apply for government grants to secure the funding that pays them, as well as to cover the costs of research projects.  Competition is fierce \u2013 so how does one measure the value of a scientist? A major metric for assessing a scientist\u2019s worth is the number of research papers they have published (a popular mantra within the scientific community is, \u201cpublish or perish\u201d). Consequently, there is often more pressure for scientists to actively work against each other than there is for them to work together.  It\u2019s true, it\u2019s hard to name a field which isn\u2019t competitive in today\u2019s climate \u2013 but this kind of competition within academia comes at a cost to everyone.  What happens when the value of a scientist is measured by their authorship figures? Rushing papers through publication decreases their quality (and even their ethical integrity) \u2013 clogging fields with unreproducible data, further complicating already complex subject matter. Individual scientists are incentivised to work against each other, so their research doesn\u2019t gain the benefit of collaboration. Lead researchers become tempted to take advantage of those below them, taking credit (paper authorship) for the work of the newest researchers in their team.  In this culture, it\u2019s perfectly normal for professors to eat their own young, and for scientists to choose the path of least resistance (more papers) over the path most likely to lead to significant discoveries. In Australia, increasing frustration around issues like these, which have a marked effect on younger researchers, led to the formation of the Early and Mid-Career Researchers (EMCR) Forum. Forum executive member Associate Professor Drew Evans works in improving the \u201cmanufacture-ability\u201d of materials \u2013 he\u2019s worked in this field in the context of both academia and industry. \u201cIn academia, we work in teams, but we are measured as individuals. In industry, you work in a team and your performance is measured as a team,\u201d explains Evans. \u201cAs an academic, my career and my future promotions are really driven by me, so if my colleague doesn\u2019t do a good job but I do, then that ends up being a positive for me. In fact, it probably works out even better for me that they don\u2019t do well, because I\u2019ll stand out. This all individual pursuit and rather nasty behaviour \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d Freshly graduated with his PhD, Dr Smith* was invited to stay in the same lab in New South Wales where his postgraduate studies were conducted. But Smith didn\u2019t want to get stuck in the ghost-writing trap he\u2019d seen the lab become. \u201cWhen I originally came into the lab after my Honours year, I was excited about continuing the project for my PhD. I was told my Honours work would become a chapter of my PhD thesis, but it ended up becoming one of my supervisor\u2019s chapters for his,\u201d explains Smith. \u201cAt the time I figured because I was younger maybe this is just how it works.\u201d \u201cWhen you come in as a bright-eyed student, you think, \u201cWow, this is really cool \u2013the things that I work on could help improve patient quality of life.\u201d But mostly what you see is: it\u2019s all about getting your name on papers.\u201d This competition can also affect access to resources and equipment. \u201cStudents from particular research groups are actively discouraged from talking to anyone outside of the group, even if it was just to get advice on using particular equipment, just in case the other group could figure out what their research was on,\u201d reveals Dr Zhang*, who is based at a South Australian research institute. In Australia, the amount of funding universities receive from the government is directly influenced by the number of PhD students they graduate. There is, however, no such incentive for improving student employability. Although there\u2019s arguably plenty of opportunities for young researchers to apply their skills outside the academic workforce, it\u2019s rare for universities to provide training for the necessary \u201cre-branding\u201d this process requires.  When young researchers leave the academy, be it through lack of funding or by choice (unsurprising when we look closely at the toxic culture some may endure), we risk wasting money, time and precious talent. This year, thanks in part to the work of the EMCR forum, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) did introduce some changes to funding. The duration of grants was extended, emphasis was placed on collaboration, the number of grants held by an individual was capped, and there was an increased focus on scientists\u2019 ideas as opposed to their publication track record.  The jury is still out as to whether these changes can have a positive effect on academic culture. \u201cWhenever there is a change in funding structure, everybody freaks out because they just don\u2019t know if it will have the desired outcome,\u201d explainsEvans. \u201cWe would love to have evidence to say that it will work, but it\u2019s all experimental which is the whole point. Simply put, we need change.\u201d *Names have been changed to protect the identity of interviewees. Dr Evans would like to make it clear that he is passing general comment on the sector as chair of the EMCR Forum. This statement in no way comments on his current employment position.
