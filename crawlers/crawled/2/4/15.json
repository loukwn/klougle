Even your own country \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to make out where France ends, and Germany begins. You just realise, very strongly, how much we all share the same problems, how much we are, all of us, almost identical.\u201d Pesquet, who arrived on the ISS six months after his friend, Britain\u2019s Tim Peake, left it, said the joint project between the US, Russian, Japanese, Canadian and European space agencies was a potent symbol of how countries can cooperate above the Earth even as below, interests diverge and tensions mount. \u201cToday no single country can go into space on its own,\u201d he said. \u201cThe days when even the US could do that are long gone. And of course, up there, it\u2019s very clear: you can only work together. You may have different views, but you have to get along. You have to make it work, every day, because you\u2019re on the same spaceship.\u201d Pesquet, 39, said his spell in space \u2013 which made him so famous in France that a semi-serious campaign was launched for him to enter the presidential race \u2013 had brought home to him the urgent need for more, not less, international cooperation in the face of the planet\u2019s \u201cextraordinary fragility\u201d. Known as the overview effect, the experience of observing from 250 miles up the reality of Earth in the vastness of space has long been known to produce a cognitive shift in some astronauts. It transformed Pesquet into a militant environmentalist.  \u201cI was already concerned about climate change and global warming,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in a general way, like everyone else. But it\u2019s happening on such a vast scale that from close up, it\u2019s hard for us to grasp. In space, you take this huge step back. You experience it, fully. That really changes something.\u201d Throughout his entire half-year stay, Pesquet said, he had been unable to take a clear picture of Beijing. \u201cYou see the air pollution: it\u2019s right there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the river and sea pollution. You see the clear-cutting in the Amazon. You see how much smaller South America\u2019s glaciers are than they were a few years ago.\u201d Viewed from orbit, what Pesquet called our \u201ctiny, fragile planet, this delicate band of atmosphere that holds all of life, with nothing else all around it for billions of light years\u201d prompted an obvious if startling comparison.  \u201cThe Earth is actually just a big spaceship, with a very, very big crew,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has to travel sensibly, be maintained and looked after properly, or its voyage is going to come to an end. That\u2019s how it felt to me. That was my experience.\u201d The obvious need for international cooperation \u2013 despite \u201cfrictions\u201d created, for example, by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accords, which Pesquet has publicly dubbed irresponsible \u2013 has made high-profile projects in which countries \u201cwork visibly together\u201d all the more important, Pesquet said.  While he regrets the Brexit vote, Pesquet, who was in London to take part in an embassy event marking France\u2019s Night of Ideas, said he did not necessarily expect it to have a major impact on the Britain\u2019s space programme beyond UK involvement in EU-run projects such as the Galileo GPS programme (whose back-up security monitoring centre, it was announced this month, is to be relocated to Spain).  The European Space Agency is not an EU body and Britain, Pesquet said, should continue to play its part. \u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cAs things stand, Europe has always been a relatively small player in space \u2013 Japan has a bigger stake in the ISS on its own than all of Europe.\u201d International space strategy over the coming years, he said, would aim to \u201copen the door\u201d for commercial operators, such as SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk and Virgin\u2019s Richard Branson, to start operating in \u201cnear space\u201d, while the professional agency astronauts push further into \u201cdeep space\u201d. The primary objective would be to send a smaller ISS into an elliptical orbit round the moon. \u201cThe moon is the focus for now, not Mars,\u201d Pesquet said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensible, immediate step. We can explore and research. Test the technology three days from Earth, rather than 300.\u201d But whatever happens, the voices of the astronauts will be important, he said. Like Peake, who gained a big UK Twitter following during his ISS mission, Pesquet was huge on social media in France (\u201cMuch bigger than Tim,\u201d he grinned. \u201cYou should write that. At one point I had five million followers on Facebook.\u201d)  He lists the benefits of space exploration: modern navigation, communications, satellite and weather forecasting technologies are all by-products of man\u2019s journeys into space. Of the 50 variables scientists use to monitor the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and climate, more than half can only be measured from space; there is vital scientific research, notably in medicine, that can only be done in space.  In the past, the job of astronaut was largely scientific. \u201cIt\u2019s about a lot more than that now,\u201d said Pesquet. \u201cIt\u2019s about teaching, demonstrating what people, and countries, can achieve when they really work together.\u201d ", "title": "Astronaut Thomas Pesquet: \u2018Earth is just a big spaceship with a crew.
