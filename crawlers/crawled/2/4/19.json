For the first few months of his life, the boy appeared to be in good health. \u201cThen we realised that he was not making proper visual contact, and discovered he was blind,\u201d Hastings Ward recalls. Subsequent diagnosis also revealed that Sam was not progressing intellectually. \u201cHis brain just couldn\u2019t join the dots,\u201d she says. Today Sam has the mental development of a six-month-old child. At the time of his diagnosis, it was not apparent what was affecting him. Then Hastings Ward and her husband Nick, who live in Bristol, were told about a pioneering scheme launched by the Department of Health. The 100,000 Genomes Project involves several teams of scientists, all of whom have been working towards a remarkably ambitious goal: the sequencing of 100,000 genomes of individuals affected by rare disorders and cancers. Later this month, the project \u2013 which was given the go-ahead by prime minister David Cameron in 2012 \u2013 will reveal that it has reached its halfway point and has sequenced its 50,000th genome. This news will be followed with the announcement later this year of major initiatives aimed at ensuring that the UK becomes a world leader in genomics medicine. The implications are enormous. Major steps are being taken towards the creation of a health service in which healing is dovetailed \u2013 or personalised \u2013 to suit the needs of individual patients. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, treatments will be tailored to fit the makeup of individual patients. The story of Sam Ward reveals the enormous potential of this approach to healthcare. After being enrolled in the 100,000 Genomes Project, Sam\u2019s DNA was sampled along with that of his mother and his father. Each of their genomes \u2013 their entire complement of genes \u2013 were then sequenced. Given that each of us has a genome made up of more than 3 billion letters of DNA, this decoding represents an enormous task, one that has required the use of some of the world\u2019s most advanced sequencing machines as well as computers capable of storing\u00a0millions of gigabytes of data. Last year several thousand genomes were sequenced this way. Those of the Ward family were among them. \u201cIt was then that we found out what was affecting Sam,\u201d said Hastings Ward, a former civil servant. The boy had a fault in the gene Grin-1, a very rare mutation that causes moderate to severe intellectual disability, low muscle tone and, in some cases, seizures. Knowing what was affecting their son was, on its own, a considerable relief. There were other \u2013 even more welcome \u2013 benefits, however. Some of these disorders do not have names and in many cases we do not know the causes. By studying the genomes of Sam\u2019s parents, doctors were able to show that neither had passed on the Grin-1 gene variant to their son. It had arisen, by chance, as a mutation inside his own DNA. \u201cThat was tremendously important,\u201d says Hastings Ward. \u201cIt showed that it is extremely unlikely that his elder sister Kirsty would be affected by the condition. That had been a real worry\u00a0for us.\u201d In addition, there has been the development \u2013 by researchers in the US \u2013 of a possible drug that could treat the condition. \u201cThat has been another very positive development for us. The project has brought tremendous relief and hope,\u201d says Hastings Ward, who now heads a panel that represents the interests of the volunteer participants in the project. Disorders such as the one caused by Grin-1 are uncommon but they still represent a significant cumulative burden on the health service. \u201cThere are between 7,000 and 8,000 rare disorders like the one that affects Sam,\u201d says Professor Mark Caulfield, the project\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cSome do not have names and in many cases we do not know the causes. And yes, each is rare: but because there are so many of them they still have a considerable impact on the wellbeing of the nation. Almost 3\u00a0million people are affected by a rare disorder in the UK. Usually these manifest themselves at an early age, in the first two or three years of life, and about a third of those affected will die by the age of five.\u201d This grim statistic explains why rare disorders were pinpointed by the founders of the project and why early successes are providing encouraging hopes for future developments in diagnoses and treatments. Hastings Ward says: \u201cWhen you have an undiagnosed child, you have no idea what lies ahead for your family. Thanks to this project, we have now found some clues, a network of families who are in a similar situation, and more hope for the future.\u201d This point is backed by Juliet Mills, who lives in Worcestershire and whose 13-year-old son Gabriel suffers from the rare disorder nemaline myopathy \u2013 a condition that leaves him struggling to walk and requiring a wheelchair to make longer journeys. \u201cSix or seven gene mutations have been linked to the disease but Gabriel does not have any of these,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have joined the 100,000 Genomes Project and are awaiting results. If we can find out exactly what is causing his condition, that will give us some hope that one day some form of treatment could be developed to help him.\u201d Rare disorders are not the only target, however. Another major component is the study and diagnosis of cancer. Patients with particular tumours are being recruited and their genomes sequenced. The genomes of their tumours are also being sequenced to trace the molecular change that turned a normally healthy piece of DNA into one that makes cells divide uncontrollably. Of the 50,000 genomes that have been sequenced so far, around 8,000 have been targeted for cancer research. These are also showing encouraging results. \u201cIf I developed cancer today \u2013 from what I have now seen \u2013 I would want to have my tumour genome sequenced,\u201d says Caulfield. \u201cThese sequences are showing us how to think about tailoring therapies and offer clinical trial opportunities that could have enormous potential. We are highlighting what changes in DNA have occurred in a patient and, crucially, we are also able to provide links to potential clinical trial opportunities from which a clinician can make a selection that best suits their patient. \u201cWe are starting to use the molecular signature of a cancer to direct a therapy for a particular patient and, hopefully, provide some with better, longer lives. This could convert some cancers to simple, longer-term\u00a0diseases.\u201d This enthusiasm is shared by Professor Sue Hill, chief scientific officer for England says: \u201cI have never seen a transformation project that has achieved quite so much in such a short time,\u201d she says. \u201cThese technologies are going to be embedded in the NHS through the new genomic medicine service from this autumn.\u201d This point is emphasised by Caulfield. \u201cFrom October, this technology is going to become available not just to those taking part in our project but to all those families who are touched by rare diseases and by certain cancers. We cannot yet say which cancers, but the long-term aim is to include all that respond to this\u00a0approach.\u201d Geneticists point out that the cost of genome sequencing is also expected to decline sharply and become even more affordable. A full genome sequence currently costs around \u00a31,000, and many less efficient diagnostic tests could be replaced. \u201cThat will release money to provide further funds for genomic medicine,\u201d says Caulfield. \u201cThe benefits of this technology are going to be profound.\u201d Alex MastersonOver the first 18 years of his life, Alex Masterson has had 28 operations, including the removal of tumours and several bouts of heart surgery. Doctors originally thought he was suffering from a condition known as Noonan syndrome, but doubts persisted. His symptoms \u2013 which included facial tumours \u2013 did not quite fit this diagnosis. These doubts were unsettling for his family. Two years ago his mother, Kirsty, was told about the 100,000 Genomes Project by the family\u2019s genetic counsellor and enrolled Alex. Sequencing of his genome revealed he had a related condition known as Leopard syndrome. \u201cIt has not changed his life expectancy or anything like that. However, it has given us closure and that has been a marvellous relief,\u201d she says. Diagnoses like Alex\u2019s can also bring alleviation from the odysseys of diagnostic visits that families with rare disorders have to go through. An affected child can face hundreds of outpatient visits to different specialists in the first few years of life as doctors struggle to trace the causes of their symptoms. By pinpointing a condition\u2019s cause, the 100,000 Genomes Project could bring an end to the stress, discomfort and costs involved, say researchers. Dilys NeillDilys Neill was a doctor who specialised in the treatment of childhood cancers when, in October 2016, she was diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukaemia, a condition in which a person\u2019s bone marrow produces white blood cells that grow and divide too fast. These abnormal cells then build up in the blood and bone marrow. \u201cMy first thought was that I would be dead before our daughter\u2019s wedding the next year and that her day would be spoiled,\u201d she recalls. However, a transplant of stem cells from her sister Ros gave Dr Neill a lifeline \u2013 to the extent that she will celebrate her 64th birthday on Monday and has been told that she has a 50-50 chance of surviving the next five\u00a0years. \u201cAs a prognosis, it could be better, but it could be a lot worse,\u201d says Dr Neill, who has now retired and lives with her husband, William, in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire. \u201cHowever, it would be better for future generations if we had ways to pinpoint the condition before it has had a chance to take a hold in a patient,\u201d she adds. And that is why she has joined the 100,000 Genomes\u00a0Project. \u201cIf a lot of patients with my condition have their genomes sequenced, it may be possible to pinpoint particular stretches of DNA that predispose certain individuals to acute myeloid leukaemia. That would be an enormous step forward in designing new treatments for the condition.\u201d Jim WrightJim Wright is 17 and a wheelchair user. His mother Karen had noticed he had problems walking when he was a toddler. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t climb stairs,\u201d she says. Jim was eventually diagnosed as having Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic condition appearing either in childhood or later in life and characterised by loss of muscle strength in the legs. However, the condition comes in numerous varieties and doctors could not determine which variant affected Jim. When the family heard about the 100,000 Genomes Project, they asked to be enrolled. Samples of DNA were taken and it was discovered that Jim had a version of Charcot-Marie-Tooth that is known as type 2z and which is caused by an alteration in his MORC2 gene. \u201cMore importantly, we found out that neither my husband nor I carried the gene responsible for our son\u2019s condition. It was a new mutation that had first appeared in Jim,\u201d says\u00a0Karen. For the Wrights \u2013 who live in Cannock, Staffordshire \u2013 this was a welcome diagnosis. \u201cIt means that our other son, Sam, is not likely to have picked up a gene for the condition and so he does not have to worry about fathering children who might inherit the condition. It also means that Jim could also father healthy children in the future \u2013 by using pre-implantation diagnosis to pinpoint embryos that do not carry the gene. This has all brought tremendous relief for my husband Kevin and I.\u201d And Jim is equally excited. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be part of a project that could bring better diagnoses and treatments for future generations,\u201d he says. The prime goal of the 100,000 Genomes Project is to sequence the entire complement of genes possessed by around 70,000 individuals in the UK. \u201cIn some cases, we will sequence a person\u2019s genome and nothing else,\u201d says Professor Mark Caulfield, the project\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cIn other cases, usually in patients affected by cancers, we will sequence their genomes and also the genomes of their tumours. And in others we will sequence the genomes of the affected person as well as the genomes of their parents.\u201d Researchers are already close to the halfway stage of their endeavour. \u201cIn the next few weeks, we expect to notch up our 50,000th genome,\u201d says Caulfield. Given that it took separate teams of US and UK geneticists almost a decade to unravel the very first human genome, in 2003, at a cost of around $3bn, this progress is remarkable. Constant improvements in sequencing technology and in data storage have played a key role in this dramatic jump in performance. \u201cEvery three years, a new generation of sequencing machines is developed and so costs and sequencing rates have been slashed,\u201d Caulfield says. \u201cOur project will achieve its goal on a budget of \u00a3300m provided entirely by the government. Without these improvements in sequencing technology, it would have cost around \u00a3200tn to fund the project.\u201d To sequence genomes, blood samples from patients and family members are sent to centres round England (Scotland, North Ireland and Wales have their own partnership projects) and then collected at a repository in Milton Keynes. From there, the samples are sent to the NHS Genome Sequencing Centre at the Sanger Institute south of Cambridge, where every one of the 3.1bn letters of DNA in each genome will be read. Around 21m gigabytes of data are expected to be generated and will be stored at the project\u2019s data centre in Corsham, Wiltshire, where it will be used to help diagnose patients\u2019 conditions and provide data for scientists studying cancers and inherited diseases.", "title": "The DNA database that is key to beating our rarest diseases"}
