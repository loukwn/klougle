O\u2019Leary said Ryanair was not as optimistic as some of its rivals that it would be able to push through fare rises this summer. Last year, the average fare was \u20ac41 (\u00a336), down 13% from the year before. This year, fares will be cut by about 3%, Ryanair said. Ryanair has been in talks with pilots since December, when it agreed to recognise trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history to avoid Christmas strikes. Last week the airline agreed that the Balpa union will represent all its British pilots in talks. But talks with some other unions have broken down and O\u2018Leary warned investors on Monday that the airline was likely to be targeted by strikes at Easter.  \u201cWe have some jurisdictions where we are getting the kind of laughable demands for legacy-type inefficiencies,\u201d O\u2018Leary said.  \u201cFrankly we will never agree to those ... if we have to take strikes or disruptions in those jurisdictions, then we will take those. But we will not under any circumstance alter or reduce our productivity.\u201d A shortage of pilots led the airline to cancel thousands of flights last year. O\u2019Leary denied there was a shortfall, saying Ryanair had recruited 1,100 cadets and would hire a further 1,000 pilots in 2018. Ryanair has met pilot unions in Ireland, UK, Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and France, with other countries to follow, and union recognition will be extended to cabin crew later in the year, O\u2019Leary said. Ryanair\u2019s fuel bill is set to rise by \u20ac300m next year, and a 20% pay rise for pilots will push up its annual wage bill by \u20ac100m.  Ryanair posted a 12% rise in profits after tax to \u20ac106m in the three months to December. It stuck to its forecast of \u20ac1.4bn to \u20ac1.45bn profit this year, although this depends on the absence of strike disruption and terrorist events.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/ryanair-chief-pilots-michael-oleary-strikes", "title": "Ryanair chief: we won't bow to laughable demands from pilots"}
