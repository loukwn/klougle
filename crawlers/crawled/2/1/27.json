We placed an order online on 30 December, and a day or two later tried to add on two toilet brushes (a total of \u00a31.80). They didn\u2019t have an option to make the payment online for these extra items, and my husband tried to ring but had difficulties getting through.  After a horrible hour on the phone, I ended up cancelling the entire \u00a3630-plus order. Ikea said the money would be refunded within seven to 10 days.  Twenty three days on, and in spite of multiple requests to speak with a manager \u2013 or receive a message from a manager \u2013 I\u2019ve heard nothing.  I\u2019ve emailed again, copying in Ikea UK and Ireland boss Gillian Drakeford. But I have little faith that I\u2019ll receive a response. EBM, Somerset Either your appeal to the highest levels, or our intervention, paid off and Ikea has (finally) pulled out all the stops. You have received an apology, a goodwill gesture of \u00a3150 and a \u00a335 Ikea gift card, which it hopes might tempt you back. Jason Richards, Ikea\u2019s customer care manager says: \u201cWe naturally want all of our customers to be happy with the service they receive, and we have been in direct contact with the customer to apologise. We have since resolved this matter to their satisfaction.\u201d We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
