Seven former Carillion directors gave evidence to MPs at the start of a joint inquiry by two select committees into the firm\u2019s liquidation earlier this month. The collapse put tens of thousands of jobs and supplier companies at risk, left hundreds of millions of pounds of public contracts unfinished and is set to saddle the government\u2019s pensions lifeboat with an estimated \u00a3800m of liabilities. During two lengthy sessions before MPs from the business select committee and counterparts on the work and pensions committee, former Carillion directors: MPs repeatedly accused Carillion directors of prioritising dividend payments over whittling down debts and plugging a pension scheme deficit estimated at \u00a3990m. Keith Cochrane, a former non-executive director who replaced Richard Howson as chief executive after a huge profit warning in July 2017, said: \u201cThrough the lens of today, if we had suspended dividends [...] would that have made a difference, possibly.\u201d But he denied the company put the financial interests of shareholders above those of its 27,000 pension scheme members. Howson said the company at one point raised its dividend \u201cto show confidence in the future\u201d of the business. All of the former directors apologised for their role in Carillion\u2019s demise, saying the company\u2019s debts and pension deficit became unsustainable as conditions deteriorated rapidly in early 2017. They blamed a phalanx of setbacks including non-payment of bills by Qatar, Brexit, the snap election in 2017, interest rates and problems building hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham. In a joint statement issued after the hearing, committee chairs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves said: \u201cThis morning a series of delusional characters maintained that everything was hunky dory until it all went suddenly and unforeseeably wrong.  \u201cWe heard variously that this was the fault of the Bank of England, the foreign exchange markets, advisers, Brexit, the snap election, investors, suppliers, the construction industry, the business culture of the Middle East and professional designers of concrete beams.  \u201cEverything we have seen points the fingers in another direction \u2013 to the people who built a giant company on sand in a desperate dash for cash.\u201d The committees also published a recovery plan that Carillion directors drew up in the days before its liquidation, that admitted it had operated with \u201can overly short-term focus, weak operational risk management and too many distractions outside of our \u2018core\u2019\u201d. During the evidence session, former finance director Zafar Khan denied a claim by Reeves that directors were \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d as the company\u2019s debts spiralled to more than \u00a31bn. He added that the company\u2019s ability to secure new contracts \u201cdrifted\u201d due to Brexit and the calling of a general election in 2017. His successor Emma Mercer said Khan and other directors had taken an \u201caggressive tone\u201d in the way they valued contracts that later underperformed. Howson pointed to a \u00a3200m bill owed by Qatar, which remained unpaid for 18 months, for work to redevelop parts of the capital city, Doha, for the 2022 World Cup. Howson said he repeatedly tried to extract payment from Qatar during monthly visits to the country, saying: \u201cI felt like a bailiff.\u201d He also pointed to problems with major contracts including the Royal Liverpool University hospital, where cracked beams led to delays, the Midland Metropolitan hospital and the Aberdeen bypass. The underperforming contracts were among those that starved the debt-laden company of cash and forced it to take an \u00a3845m financial hit six months before its failure. At the end of the session, business committee chair Reeves invited the former directors to pledge to give back their bonuses but none took the opportunity. \u201cAll of you sitting here received multimillion payments from Carillion,\u201d she said. \u201cYou say how sad and disappointed you are but what actions do you take?  \u201cIt\u2019s just words. The money\u2019s in the bank. Why don\u2019t you give some money back and try to put right some of this wrong?\u201d Howson, who received cash-plus-shares bonuses worth nearly \u00a31m in 2016, said he would do so if required by the government\u2019s official receiver, adding that the portion paid in shares was already worthless. Earlier, Cochrane said that before he became chief executive, he and other directors could have done more to flag up the growing problems. He said: \u201cClearly with the benefit of hindsight, should the board have been asking further, more probing questions, perhaps.\u201d Asked about the firm\u2019s last-ditch bid for survival in January, Cochrane said directors asked the government for a \u00a3160m cash injection but were refused. \u201cWe believed a longer-term solution was possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat solution would have been the best possible outcome for [the] pension fund, customers, suppliers and employees.\u201d", "title": "Former Carillion directors branded 'delusional' at MPs' Q&A"}
