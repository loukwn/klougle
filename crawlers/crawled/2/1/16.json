It was a volatile open session as shares fell further into the red before investors regained their nerve and the Dow rose 184 points or 0.6% to 24,527. The gains followed the biggest ever one-day points fall on the US index on Monday, when the Dow plunged by 1,175 as traders bet on interest rate rises.  The FTSE 100 of Britain\u2019s biggest listed companies initially fell by 255 points or 3.5% to 7,079.41 as the turmoil spread to global markets. The index later recovered some of its losses, and was down 138 points or 1.9% at 7,196. 1) 20 October 1987\u00a0-12.22%2) 19 October 1987\u00a0-10.84%Black Monday (October 19) followed a plunge on Wall Street on the previous Friday when UK markets were shut due to a hurricane hitting the country.

Falls in Europe followed a near 5% drop in Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index and a 3.3% fall on Australia\u2019s ASX200.  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index declined by as much as 7% during the day\u2019s trade before a slight recovery to close down 4.7%. The Nikkei\u2019s decline of 1,071.84 points was its largest points fall since 2016. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. For several weeks, economists and analysts have warned that inflation levels in major economies could increase this year beyond the 2% to 3% that central banks believe is good for developed countries. Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US\u00a0had reached 2.9%. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five. There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0tax reform bill, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue. Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming\u00a0US economy\u00a0will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US. \u201cThe sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,\u201d she told Kyodo News. Other markets across Asia also suffered losses. South Korea\u2019s Composite Stock Price Index fell by about 3% in morning trade. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index plunged 4.9% while the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2%. These losses followed the dive in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, with investors appearing to react to equity losses and concerns that central banks will soon increase interest rates to rein in inflation. It coincided with the arrival of Jerome Powell as the new chair of the US Federal Reserve. \u201cThis was volatility unleashed,\u201d said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u201d While market fear may not be based in any change in economic fundamentals, in its last meeting under chair Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase through the year. According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 \u2013 so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are \u2013 but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year. If the market falls continue they could prove problematic for Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals \u201cremain exceptionally strong\u201d. Vice President Mike Pence characterised the stock market\u2019s plunge as \u201csimply the ebb and flow of our stock market\u201d.  On Monday, the FTSE 100 suffered its worst single-day slump since Theresa May called the snap election last April.  The index fell 1.3% to 7,345 \u2013 having peaked at almost 7,800 last month \u2013 extending its longest losing streak since November into a fifth day.  \u201cThe era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u2019s undoubtedly bad news,\u201d said Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at currency dealer FXTM.", "title": "FTSE and European stock markets fall after US and Asia rout"}
