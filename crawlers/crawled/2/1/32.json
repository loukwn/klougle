The flexible working trend and absence of secure job markets certainly seems to work for the corporations, which no longer choose to even employ people but instead offer only short-term contractor assignments where they take no responsible for their workers. It does not, however, work for those of us stuck in the new zero-hours contracts, short-term, fixed-term, day-rate culture. In these markets we are seen as servants to those client corporations and therefore at their beck and call, 24/7. I have gone from a well-paid, secure, permanent job some six years ago to being forced into the contracting market of short-term assignments. The roles available have no security, no pension and leave you living hand-to-mouth from one contract assignment to the next. I haven\u2019t been able to plan financially, to buy a house, to settle. I work hard (and have always worked hard) as an experienced professional, but I honestly long for the days of having a permanent, steady job and feeling part of a team and of something long-term.  Sadly, those days seem to be over for the vast majority of us and the trend only seems set to continue down this uncertain path. In my experience, after contracting for many years I have found it extremely difficult to get back into full-time employment as those jobs no longer seem to exist. I feel I have a lot to offer but not as a freelancer, a contractor, an alternative workforce. I just can\u2019t see how this new job market benefits me as \u201cflexible working\u201d. So do I simply have to accept this uncertainty as the new working environment \u2013 the new norm \u2013 or is there another way to gain job security? \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Working It Out asking for help, and may well view your comments here. \u2022 If you have a problem at work, this is your chance to get some advice.
