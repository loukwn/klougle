Judge Deborah Taylor discharged the jury on Monday, saying it would not be \u201cright and proper\u201d to continue the trial after Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, suffered a heart attack last week, leaving him \u201cin hospital awaiting surgery\u201d. A ruling by the judge prevented reporting of the decision until Tuesday. A provisional retrial date has been set for 3 September. Rogberg and his former colleagues John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, and Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, had all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting.  The charges against the three allege that they dishonestly falsified Tesco\u2019s digital accounting records and its draft interim accounts by the \u201cinputting of and/or reliance upon commercial income figures which gave a false account of the financial position of Tesco\u201d. Neil O\u2019May of Norton Rose Fulbright, solicitor to Rogberg, said his client had had a heart attack last Thursday and would undergo surgery on Friday.  \u201cMr Rogberg is devastated at the news that the trial has been aborted. He waived his right to attend these last stages after he had given evidence himself for many days, and had participated in the last four and half months of the trial,\u201d he said outside the court on Tuesday. O\u2019May said Rogberg \u201cwas always very anxious that this jury should be allowed to reach its verdict and is desperately sorry that they were prevented from doing so\u201d. In her ruling on discharging the jury, Taylor accepted that the majority of the defendants wanted to continue with the trial, which she admitted had already suffered \u201cvarious delays through no fault of the defendants\u201d. However, she said that whatever the jurors were told about Rogberg\u2019s illness at a \u201ccritical stage\u201d in the lengthy trial was \u201clikely to influence the decision that they make\u201d in some way.  Taylor said that if they were not told the details of his illness there was \u201csubstantial risk that they may not take a sympathetic view\u201d. If they were told he had suffered a heart attack without further details \u201cit could be prejudicial to the Serious Fraud Office\u201d or lead them to be more sympathetic to Rogberg and less so towards his co-defendants. She said: \u201cIt would not be a proper course in the circumstances of a case of this importance to all concerned to introduce what ... has [been] described as a wild card at this stage.\u201d", "title": "Tesco fraud trial abandoned after defendant taken ill"}
