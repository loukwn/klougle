GA, Morpeth, Northumberland Given the end of January deadline for self-assessment tax returns to be completed, there are a lot of these kinds of scams whizzing around right now designed to mislead. HMRC tells consumers to check common examples of phishing emails and bogus contacts which it has listed online. It says it will also help its investigations if consumers report \u201cHMRC-related\u201d websites, emails, phone numbers, phone calls or text messages that they think may be suspicious. Forward them to phishing@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk and then delete them. In addition, don\u2019t open any attachments or click on any links, as they may contain malicious software or direct you to a bogus website. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Please include a daytime phone number.
