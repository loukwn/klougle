Angered by revelations about the number of empty apartments in \u201cposh ghost towers\u201d , Ian Bone, a veteran campaigner and founder of anarchist newspaper Class War, attempted to organise a \u201cnoisy, but peaceful\u201d protest outside the Shard. Families of some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower tragedy were due to join him in the demonstration. \u201cAnyone know where the entrance for the luxury apartments at the Shard is?,\u201d Bone, 70, posted on Facebook last Wednesday. \u201cWe are starting weekly actions \u2013 Thursdays 6-8pm starting Feb 8th.\u201d  Less than 48 hours after making the Facebook post, Bone was issued with a summons to appear at the high court this Thursday \u2013 the day of the planned protest. The Shard\u2019s owners and management company applied to the court for an immediate injunction preventing Bone and \u201cpersons unknown\u201d from entering the Shard or land near the building.  Bone, an anarchist who had previously led campaigns against developers\u2019 use of \u201cpoor doors\u201d to separate rich homebuyers from poorer tenants, had asked fellow protesters to \u201cbring yer own banners\u201d and musical instruments to the planned protest. \u201cWe also want musicians to come down and play, sing, dance, rant ... need yer own amps,\u201d he said in the post.  He called on supporters to engage in \u201clow-intensity operations\u201d at the Shard, including suggestions to \u201cask at the doors to see the \u00a350 MILLION FLATS\u201d, \u201cmake a reservation at one \u2013 or all \u2013 of the [Shard] restaurants [and] ask if you can bring your own food\u201d, and \u201cshout about the injustice of empty flats and GRENFELL\u201d.  Bone\u2019s Facebook posts, which were included in evidence filed at the high court, also said: \u201cObviously THE AIM IS TO OCCUPY THE EMPTY APARTMENTS eventually but the first couple [of protests] are more likely to be battles over space, where the cops and management want to stick us and where we want to go.\u201d  Bone told the Guardian that his apparent threat to occupy the empty apartments, one of which was originally marketed for more than \u00a350m, was \u201cclearly a joke\u201d and not a serious threat. \u201cWe just wanted to highlight the growing and worrying inequality in London, with all these empty towers for rich people and no homes for thousands of us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, dozens of families from the Grenfell Tower tragedy are still without permanent homes.\u201d The Shard, which is ultimately owned by the Qatari royal family, was chosen as the venue for the protest after Guardian revelations that all 10 of the multimillion-pound apartments near the top of the tower remain empty more than five years after Qatar\u2019s prime minister opened the tower.  Evidence filed by the Shard\u2019s owners at the high court includes a detailed \u201cintelligence report\u201d on Bone compiled by private security firm VSG. The report described Bone as the leader of anarchist movement Class War, and said he \u201cwalks with a cane and generally is belligerent and uncooperative when interacting with persons of authority, such as police officers and security officers\u201d.  Bone told the Guardian he had never struck anyone with his cane, and pointed out he was unable to walk without it as he has had Parkinson\u2019s disease for the past decade.  The VSG report described Class War as \u201ca small but passionate group of leftwing, pro-anarchy activists with a long and proven history of campaigning against \u2018the elite\u2019 and other entities associated with wealth or perceived social injustice\u201d. The report advised the Shard\u2019s owners that if Bone\u2019s protest was allowed to take place it could endure for months and \u201cattract widespread media coverage\u201d. It also warned that activists could use \u201cpyrotechnics and large, offensive banners of a derogatory nature\u201d. In 2015, Class War coordinated an anti-gentrification protest that resulted in a breakfast cereal cafe in London\u2019s Shoreditch being covered with paint bombs and graffiti. Bone, who had previously lived in Grenfell Tower and spent time sleeping rough, said he had no intention of causing a public nuisance and \u201cjust wanted to highlight the obscenity of having huge empty luxury towers when so many are homeless and struggling\u201d. \u201cThis is the billionaire Qatari royal family against a little old pensioner,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cMy pension is \u00a3154.56 a week,\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cThe Qatari royals are taking me to the high court of justice to stop me and persons unknown protesting outside their SHARD about their empty luxury apartments. Some Grenfell people are coming. I lived in Grenfell and was later homeless myself. The Qatari royals feel they can stop protest in the UK over their obscene 10 \u00a350m empty apartments while 70 Grenfell families are still in hotels and 4,000 sleep rough in London every night..\u201d Andr\u00e9 Frank Baker, a former Metropolitan police commander and head of the Shard\u2019s security team, said in evidence filed with the court that he was concerned about Bone coming near the tower because he had published a book entitled Bash the Rich: True Life Confessions of an Anarchist in the UK.  \u201cI instructed lawyers this morning and was advised that an urgent injunction should be pursued,\u201d Baker said in his witness statement. \u201cThe threat could materialise at any time ... It was thought appropriate to pursue an injunction without notice. Given that the stated objective of this anarchist campaign is to unlawfully occupy vacant apartments at the Shard and cause disruption generally, I and the claimants take this threat extremely seriously.\u201d The Shard\u2019s management company, Real Estate Management (UK), did not respond to requests for comment.
