Matthew Taylor said the government must urgently address poor quality work in Britain after the Guardian revealed how Don Lane, a 53-year-old father of one, collapsed and died from diabetes after being fined \u00a3150 by the courier company for attending a hospital appointment to treat his disease.  Lane missed three other hospital appointments to treat kidney damage, partly because he was afraid of being fined. He collapsed at the wheel of his van while on deliveries a few months before dying in January. After the Guardian revealed the story, there were signs of a consumer backlash, with shoppers telling DPD and M&S they would consider stopping using them because of Lane\u2019s treatment. One DPD customer wrote on the firm\u2019s online feedback form: \u201cHow about giving them some sick leave. Shocked by reports in the paper. Would think twice about using DPD if that\u2019s how you treat people.\u201d An M&S customer posted on Twitter: \u201cIn future when I order online, especially with M&S, if the delivery company is DPD I shall cancel the order and order with a company which doesn\u2019t use DPD.\u201d A spokesman for M&S, one of the courier firm\u2019s biggest clients, said it was \u201cvery sad\u201d about Lane\u2019s death. It added: \u201cThe circumstances will be raised as part of our ongoing discussions with courier providers.\u201d We would like to find out how consumers opinions and habits might be changing in light of stories about companies employing gig economy workers.

Lane worked as a self-employed courier for DPD delivering parcels in Dorset on behalf of M&S, John Lewis and Amazon. The company made more than \u00a3100m in profit last year, the equivalent of \u00a320,000 per courier, but does not provide sick pay or paid holiday. After the Guardian revealed the circumstances of Lane\u2019s death, it apologised for fining him in July but denied that when he first collapsed seven months earlier he was threatened with \u00a3150 charges. His death has increased the political pressure for reform of work practices at the bottom of the UK\u2019s labour market. On Wednesday, Downing Street is expected to finally announce its response to employment reforms proposed by Taylor last July, but the backdrop is now a chorus of anger from gig economy workers, consumers, trade unions and MPs united in opposition at how Lane was treated. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, described Lane\u2019s case as heartbreaking. She said: \u201cBad conditions, bogus self-employment and the non-enforcement of rights have become all too common in Tory Britain and this case shows just how broken the system is. The government must now publish its long overdue response to the Taylor review and finally take action to tackle the Dickensian conditions too often faced by delivery drivers.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the secretary general of the TUC, said it was \u201ca tragedy\u201d. She said Theresa May\u2019s response would be \u201can acid test\u201d of the government\u2019s commitment to \u201ccreating a Britain that works for all\u201d.  Taylor, who was recruited by May to propose reforms to modern working practices shortly after she entered Downing Street, said:  \u201cGenuine self-employment provides benefits which compensate for the fact that you don\u2019t have sick pay or consultation rights. The problem with the model that Don Lane was working under is that it looks as though you get very little of those upsides. His experience shows we urgently need to address poor quality work, particularly at the bottom of the labour market.\u201d In Scotland, more than 100 couriers for DPD have joined the GMB trade union and in December withdrew their labour for a day in protest at unilateral changes to their contracts and against the \u00a3150 fines.  \u201cIt is a shocking story,\u201d said Cal Waterson, a regional GMB organiser. \u201cThere has been a strong backlash. We have a member in Scotland who had his licence removed by the DVLA because he didn\u2019t attend his appointments to control his diabetes. He missed the appointments because he couldn\u2019t get time off work.\u201d There was also widespread solidarity with Lane and his widow, Ruth, from other DPD depots. \u201c\u00a3150 is a lot of money for most people so people put their health second in order to provide for their family,\u201d said a DPD courier in Peterborough, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with it and Theresa May could do something about this but she seems to have no interest in looking after us. Society is getting more and more selfish.\u201d When first contacted for comment over Lane\u2019s death, DPD said it was shocked and saddened and said it did not know he had previously fallen into a diabetic coma or that he had vomited blood before his death. The firm said Lane had a quiet rural route that was convenient for his hospital appointments. DPD said on Monday it was ready to discuss customer concerns about Lane\u2019s death. A spokesman said: \u201cLike all companies, we make mistakes, and we have apologised profoundly for a mistake we made in Don\u2019s case.\u201d A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy extended deepest sympathies to Lane\u2019s family and said: \u201cEmployers must take their employment responsibilities seriously.\u201d He added: \u201cWe recognise concerns that the UK\u2019s flexible labour market is not working fairly for everyone. That\u2019s why we asked Matthew Taylor to review modern working practices and the government will respond to the review shortly.\u201d ", "title": "Pressure grows on DPD and Theresa May after courier dies of diabetes"}
