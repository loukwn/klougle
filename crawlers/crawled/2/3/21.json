Zuckerberg\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution \u2013 a tradition for the executive who in previous years has pledged to learn Mandarin, run 365 miles, and read a book each week \u2013 is a remarkable acknowledgment of the terrible year Facebook has had. \u201cFacebook has a lot of work to do \u2013 whether it\u2019s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cWe won\u2019t prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools.\u201d At the beginning of 2017, as many liberals were grappling with Donald Trump\u2019s election and the widening divisions in American society, Zuckerberg embarked on a series of trips to meet regular Americans in all 50 states. But while Zuckerberg was donning hard hats and riding tractors, an increasing number of critics both inside and outside of the tech industry were identifying Facebook as a key driver of many of society\u2019s current ills. The past year has seen the social media company try \u2013 and largely fail \u2013 to get a handle on the proliferation of misinformation on its platform; acknowledge that it enabled a Russian influence operation to influence the US presidential election; and concede that its products can damage users\u2019 mental health.  By attempting to take on these complex problems as his annual personal challenge, Zuckerberg is, for the first time, setting himself a task that he is unlikely to achieve. With 2 billion users and a presence in almost every country, the company\u2019s challenges are no longer bugs that can be addressed by engineering code.  Facebook, like other tech giants, has long maintained that it is essentially politically neutral \u2013 the company has \u201ccommunity standards\u201d but no clearly articulated political orientation. While in past years, that neutrality has enabled Facebook to grow at great speed without assuming responsibility for how individuals or governments used its tools, the political tumult of recent years has made such a stance increasingly untenable.  The difficulty of Facebook\u2019s task is illustrated in the company\u2019s current conundrum over enforcing of US sanctions against some world leaders but not others, leaving observers to wonder what rules, if any, Facebook is actually playing by.  Zuckerberg acknowledged that the problems facing a platform with 2 billion users \u201ctouch on questions of history, civics, political philosophy, media, government, and of course technology\u201d and said that he planned to consult with experts in those fields.  But the second half of Zuckerberg\u2019s post, in which he discusses centralization and decentralization of power in technology, reveal Zuckerberg\u2019s general approach: proposing technological solutions to political problems. If Zuckerberg is interested in decentralization of power, he might wish to address his company\u2019s pattern of aggressively acquiring its competitors \u2013 or simply copying their features.  Instead, the executive introduced a non sequitur about encryption and cryptocurrency, neither of which will do anything to address Facebook\u2019s role in, for example, stoking anti-Rohingya hatred in Myanmar. If Zuckerberg truly intends to spend a year trying to figure out how the blockchain can solve intractable geopolitical problems, he would be better off just doing Whole30.", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg sets toughest new year's goal yet: fixing Facebook"}
