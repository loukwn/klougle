You\u2019re hunting them because someone you love is gone, and you selfishly want them back. This inversion of a founding trope of video games was groundbreaking in 2005, when Shadow of the Colossus was first released. It has now been remade for the PlayStation 4, its austere architecture and mournful colossi resplendent in ultra high-definition. Remaking this game for modern technology cannot have been easy; bringing it into the unforgiving light of the HD era risked exposing its flaws. On the PlayStation 2, fog masked landscapes too big for the technology to render, and frustrations around basic camera and movement controls could be forgiven in light of the game\u2019s sheer ambition. Now technology has caught up with Shadow of the Colossus\u2019 vision, but the mystery has not diminished. If anything, the new level of detail only emphasises the eerie emptiness of the scenery as you ride towards your next foe, heightening the sense that something is terribly wrong. The lighting is particularly noteworthy: a pale sun shines over open plains, filtered through trees to create beautiful shafts of light in forests, reflected on the surface of pools. It creates an impression of space and absence. A new photo mode allows you to freeze the game and capture these scenes. It looks so beautiful that it\u2019s difficult to resist doing so every five minutes. Creative director Fumito Ueda is known for the understated loneliness of his games \u2013 their desolate places, tragically frail human \u201cheroes\u201d, washed-out colours and the absence of the predictable power fantasies that often drive video game narratives. They allow space for reflection, for getting lost, for melancholy, instead of bombarding your senses with colour and sound. Video games are on the whole more varied and artistically interesting than they were when Shadow of the Colossus was first released, but 13 years on it still stands out as a work of extraordinary beauty and quiet profundity. What was \u2013 and is \u2013 most impactful about Shadow of the Colossus is its sense of scale: the immensity not only of its dramatic ruins and the sad, beautiful colossi, but of the task at hand, and its themes of death, faith, longing and the destructive selfishness of grief.", "title": "Shadow of the Colossus review \u2013 a game of majesty and melancholy steps back into the light"}
