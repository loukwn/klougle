Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University, said bitcoin was \u201cthe mother of all bubbles\u201d favoured by \u201ccharlatans and swindlers\u201d as it fell below $8,000 (\u00a35,600) early on Friday, marking a 30% drop since the beginning of the week as investors became increasingly twitchy about a clampdown on cryptocurrencies by regulators. Later it rallied, climbing back over $8,600 by 3pm (GMT). Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since hitting a peak of near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. Dubbed \u201cDr Doom\u201d, Roubini said the sharp fall was the beginning of a crash that would see the value of the digital currency plummet \u201call the way down to zero\u201d. Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d \u2013 a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption \u2013\u00a0or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The latest sell-off follows reports that US regulators are investigating whether the spike in the price of bitcoin in 2017 was the result of market manipulation. India\u2019s finance minister said the country did not recognise the cryptocurrency as legal tender, pledging to fight their use for \u201cillegitimate activities\u201d. Digital currencies have also been hit by the news that Facebook is banning all adverts for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, ripple, litecoin and other digital currencies all suffered double-digit percentage falls on Friday as investors took fright. \u201cPolicymakers and regulators are getting worried. Pretty much every G20 policymaker is talking about a crackdown,\u201d Roubini told Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow it to become the next Swiss bank account for use by criminals and people evading tax.\u201d He added that the 1,300 cryptocurrencies or initial coin offerings currently in existence were \u201ca scam\u201d. \u201cMost of them are even worse [than bitcoin] and don\u2019t have any intrinsic value like bitcoin. So if bitcoin is a bubble, it\u2019s a bubble to the power of two or three.\u201d Critics have warned that bitcoin has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble that could burst, like the dotcom boom and the US sub-prime housing crash that triggered the global financial crisis. Last year it rose in value by more than 900%, making it the best performing asset of 2017. Robert Shiller, the Nobel prize-winning economist, said last week that while bitcoin was a \u201creally clever idea\u201d, it would not become a permanent part of the financial world. \u201cI tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it\u2019s not a permanent feature of our lives,\u201d he said, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Bitcoin is not recognised by any central bank and currently allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods to pay for goods and services. Banks and other financial institutions have been concerned about bitcoin\u2019s early associations with money laundering and online crime, and it has not been adopted by any government. However, the spike in the price is forcing regulators and institutions to consider how to respond. Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, has said that bitcoin is too small to pose a risk to the global economy. However, he warned that investors should \u201cdo their homework\u201d before backing the digital currency. \u201cThe wheels are coming off the bitcoin bandwagon,\u201d said Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital. \u201cThe regulatory crunch appears closer than ever and sooner or later this market could be headed back down to earth. Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late. Trying to catch the falling knife is a risky game.\u201d", "title": "Bitcoin biggest bubble in history, says economist who predicted 2008 crash"}
