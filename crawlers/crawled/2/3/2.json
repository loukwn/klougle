The disorder is characterised by behaviours such as impaired control of time spent playing video games and prioritisation of gaming above other activities, in a way that negatively affects other areas of a person\u2019s life such as their education, occupation and relationships. Games industry bodies the US Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie) have expressed doubts about the classification. \u201cWe are very concerned about the inconclusive nature of the research and the evidence that WHO is using to base this potential classification on,\u201d says Ukie\u2019s chief executive, Jo Twist.  Some researchers agree. \u201cI just feel like we don\u2019t know enough yet,\u201d says Dr Netta Weinstein, a senior lecturer in psychology at Cardiff University. \u201cAnd we feel we know a lot.\u201d According to a paper by researchers who were involved in the process, the WHO was initially exploring excessive use of the internet, computers, smartphones and similar electronic devices, but determined that the biggest concern was gaming. Reviews of the literature identified characteristics such as impaired control, increased priority, and continuation despite negative consequences. The authors write: \u201cThese features clearly have their parallels with substance disorders and recognised behavioural addictions, such as gambling disorder.\u201d Weinstein is unconvinced. \u201cIn our research,\u201d she says, \u201cwe found very small correlations, if at all, of symptomology with broader life wellbeing. So we actually didn\u2019t find, for example, that symptoms correlated with health directly.\u201d And without the kinds of health effects you\u2019d see in something like drug addiction, \u201cit might be that something that we think of as addiction is actually just engagement and enthusiasm\u201d. In 2017, researcher Patrick Markey told the Guardian: \u201cI think a lot of the issues come from just how we use the term \u2018addiction\u2019.\u201d There is a small minority of people out there where gaming has completely taken over their lives Prof Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University, who was part of the working party set up by the WHO to look into the classification, takes a firmer stance: \u201cThe bottom line is problematic gaming. Whether you call it \u2018gaming disorder\u2019, whether you call it \u2018gaming addiction\u2019, there is a small minority of people out there where gaming has completely taken over their lives.\u201d It has been reported that in extreme cases some people have played themselves to death, though such incidents are extremely rare. Weinstein\u2019s research found the prevalence of disordered gaming to be nearly half that of gambling disorder. Even Griffiths agrees that the prevalence is comparatively low: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to say that the problem is bigger than it actually is.\u201d But, as he and other authors point out in a paper in the Journal of Behavioural Addictions that aims to address these kinds of concerns: \u201cAs far as we are aware, there is no minimum number of cases needed to be identified for a disorder to be classed as such.\u201d Then again, as Weinstein puts it: \u201cWhy do so many people play and so few get addicted? What does it mean about the nature of games and their addictive qualities? Gambling is in itself an activity that sort of pulls for that compulsiveness. Once we say games are also an activity that pulls for that compulsiveness, the question is why aren\u2019t more people then getting pulled into it?\u201d  Perhaps the habitually defensive games industry needs to admit that even if most games are only as addictive as watching television (or, as Markey suggested, gardening), at least some elements of modern video games are closer to gambling. The newly popular and increasingly controversial implementation of \u201cloot boxes\u201d, where players pay real money for unpredictable rewards, is increasingly drawing the attention of regulators. Weinstein has a related concern about comorbidity (when a person has more than one condition): \u201cWe need to know that it is about the gaming itself, or we\u2019re treating something that\u2019s not the actual problem.\u201d  You have to look at pre-existing mental health disorders. This is risking misdiagnosing of other underlying issues Twist agrees: \u201cYou have to look at pre-existing mental health disorders,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is risking a misdiagnosing of other underlying issues.\u201d Griffiths\u2019 own research includes case studies of four teenagers seeking treatment for gaming disorder, three of whom had comorbidities (autism, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit disorder). But he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s an argument against the classification: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single [case of] addiction where there aren\u2019t any other comorbidities. The addiction is usually symptomatic of other underlying problems. If you\u2019re depressed and therefore you drink heavily, then you treat that with antidepressants.\u201d Perhaps more significant are the cultural differences, with prevalence of gaming disorder among young people estimated to be 10-15% in some Asian countries compared to 1-10% in the west, and representatives revealing that the WHO has \u201cbeen under enormous pressure, especially from Asian countries\u201d to include the classification.  Griffiths thinks this is where we need more research: \u201cObviously in south-east Asia there seems to be a lot more, in terms of the prevalence of gaming disorder in China, in Taiwan, in South Korea, in Singapore, etc. But it\u2019s also the case there that any activity that takes away from the family and educational duties is pathologised.\u201d If we imply that Asian countries overestimate the prevalence of gaming disorder, how do we know that those of us in the west aren\u2019t also pathologising normal behaviour? This is Twist\u2019s concern. \u201cWe already suffer in the media from a kind of misunderstanding of what games are,\u201d she says. \u201cI would worry that this potential diagnosis would pathologise something that is a normal healthy behaviour. It\u2019s really important that we get the evidence base right and we don\u2019t give people even more of a moral panic about new technologies.\u201d Griffiths agrees that parents, for example, might pathologise their children\u2019s normal behaviour: \u201cParents will ring me up and say, \u2018I think my child\u2019s addicted to playing video games,\u2019 and when I say, \u2018Why do you think that?\u2019, and they say, \u2018Because they\u2019re playing four hours a day,\u2019 I have to say, \u2018That\u2019s pretty normal.\u2019\u201d  Having clear diagnostic criteria would help people make these distinctions. And to those who worry about the possibility of false positives, Griffiths says: \u201cThat\u2019s just rubbish, because you can\u2019t be given a diagnosis unless it\u2019s from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.\u201d The classification will have other consequences, however. As Weinstein says: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to have something officially a clinical diagnosis, and one of the reasons it\u2019s a big deal is that it becomes expensive.\u201d She worries that the classification represents a premature assumption that would shift resources on to research into methods of treatment instead of whether or not treatment is actually necessary. Then again, as Griffiths points out, if gaming disorder is treatable, its inclusion in the ICD would mean sufferers in countries like the United States could get treatment covered by their health insurance. The significance of the WHO\u2019s decision will depend on your point of view. Griffiths admits it\u2019s \u201ca vindication for three decades of research\u201d. Trade bodies such as Ukie naturally resist suggestions that anything their industry produces could be harmful. Parents and perhaps even governments could take it as justification for their discomfort with the younger generation\u2019s technological habits. But to a person who feels that their gaming behaviour is having a negative impact on their life, even if it\u2019s a symptom of other issues, this official acknowledgement could offer a welcome step forward.", "title": "'Dangerous gaming': is the WHO right to class excessive video game play as a health disorder?"}
