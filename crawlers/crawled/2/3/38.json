The study, from the university\u2019s \u201ccomputational propaganda project\u201d, looked at the most significant sources of \u201cjunk news\u201d shared in the three months leading up to Donald Trump\u2019s first State of the Union address this January, and tried to find out who was sharing them and why. \u201cOn Twitter, a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news, and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share,\u201d the researchers concluded. On Facebook, the skew was even greater. There, \u201cextreme hard right pages \u2013 distinct from Republican pages \u2013 share more junk news than all the other audiences put together.\u201d The research involved monitoring a core group of around 13,500 politically-active US Twitter users, and a separate group of 48,000 public Facebook pages, to find the external websites that they were sharing. Users who shared similar collections of links were grouped together depending on what they were discussing: on Twitter, some identified cohorts included \u201cConservative Media\u201d, \u201cTrump Supporters\u201d (a distinct group from \u201cRepublican Party\u201d) and \u201cResistance\u201d; on Facebook, those audience groups included \u201cHard Conservative\u201d, \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights\u201d and \u201cMilitary/Guns\u201d. The findings speak to the level of polarisation common across the US political divide. \u201cThe two main political parties, Democrats and Republicans, prefer different sources of political news, with limited overlap,\u201d the researchers write.  But there was a clear skew in who shared links from the 91 sites the researchers had manually coded as \u201cjunk news\u201d (based on breaching at least three of five quality standards including \u201cprofessionalism\u201d, \u201cbias\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d). \u201cThe Trump Support group consumes the highest volume of junk news sources on Twitter, and spreads more junk news sources, than all the other groups put together. This pattern is repeated on Facebook, where the Hard Conservatives group consumed the highest proportion of junk news.\u201d One thing the study did not find is evidence of substantial amounts of Russian news sources being shared. \u201cThe political conversations on social media exclude a Russian audience group,\u201d the researchers concluded.", "title": "Fake news sharing in US is a rightwing thing, says study"}
