Tech companies are conducting a massive, real-time experiment on our kids The campaign will include educational material aimed at families highlighting the potential harm caused by digital platforms and outlining techniques for mitigating the addictive properties of tech, for example turning off notifications and changing the screen to greyscale. There will also be a lobbying push around the issue calling for policymakers to regulate tech companies using manipulative practices and the two organisations will develop standards of ethical design to help the industry discourage digital addiction.  The Center for Humane Technology is led by former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris and former Facebook investor and adviser Roger McNamee. \u201cTech companies are conducting a massive, real-time experiment on our kids, and, at present, no one is really holding them accountable,\u201d said Common Sense\u2019s CEO, James Steyer, warning that tech companies\u2019 attention-grabbing business models may hurt \u201cthe social, emotional and cognitive development of kids\u201d. \u201cWhen parents learn how these companies can take advantage of our kids, they will join us in demanding the industry change its ways and improve certain practices.\u201d According to research by Common Sense, teenagers consume an average of nine hours of media per day, while tweens consume six hours. A separate study by psychologist Jean Twenge found that heavy users of digital media are 56% more likely to say they are unhappy and 27% more likely to be depressed. This is the latest chapter in a rising backlash against big tech. Many former employees of large Silicon Valley firms have offered sharp critiques of the industry.  In November, Facebook\u2019s founding president, Sean Parker, said the social network knew from the outset it was creating something that exploited a \u201cvulnerability in human psychology\u201d. \u201cGod only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains,\u201d he said.  In January, the Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff, said that Facebook should be regulated like the cigarette industry.
