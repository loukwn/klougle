The evidence appended to the lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, includes a message from Rachel Whetstone, who worked as a senior Google executive after a career in the UK Conservative party, bemoaning \u201cprejudiced and antagonistic\u201d political discourse at the company. Damore, who was fired in 2017 after writing a controversial memo about gender and technology, alleges in the lawsuit that white, male conservative employees at Google are \u201costracized, belittled, and punished\u201d.  The lawsuit claims that numerous Google managers maintained \u201cblacklists\u201d of conservative employees with whom they refused to work; that Google has a list of conservatives who are banned from visiting the campus; and that Google\u2019s firings of Damore and the other named plaintiff, David Gudeman, were discriminatory. \u201cWe look forward to defending against Mr Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The company\u2019s workforce, like much of the rest of the tech industry, is overwhelmingly white, Asian, and male. In 2017, the US Department of Labor accused Google of \u201cextreme pay discrimination\u201d against women, and a group of women have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company alleging systemic wage discrimination. But the Damore lawsuit purports to expose a cultural bias toward promoting diversity and \u201csocial justice\u201d that, the suit claims, has created a \u201cprotected, distorted bubble of groupthink\u201d. Efforts to increase the representation of women and underrepresented racial minorities, which companies like Google have undertaken in response to external criticism, are cast in the suit as illegal discrimination against the majority.  Screenshots of internal communications reveal numerous employees appearing to support the idea of being intolerant toward certain points of view, such as one post arguing that Google should respond to Damore\u2019s memo by \u201cdisciplining or terminating those who have expressed support\u201d. In another post, a manager stated his intention to \u201csilence\u201d certain \u201cviolently offensive\u201d perspectives, writing: \u201cThere are certain \u2018alternative views, including different political views\u2019 which I do not want people to feel safe to share here \u2026 You can believe that women or minorities are unqualified all you like \u2026 but if you say it out loud, then you deserve what\u2019s coming to you\u201d.   Internal posts discussing the debate around diversity at Google, such as a meme of a penguin with the text \u201cIf you want to increase diversity at Google fire all the bigoted white men\u201d, are filed as an appendix to the lawsuit under the heading \u201cAnti-Caucasian postings\u201d. One manager is quoted as posting: \u201cI keep a written blacklist of people whom I will never allow on or near my team, based on how they view and treat their coworkers. That blacklist got a little longer today.\u201d Another screenshot reveals a manager proposing the creation of a list of \u201cpeople who make diversity difficult\u201d, and weighing the possibility that individuals could have \u201csomething resembling a trial\u201d before being included. In the 2014 email from Whetstone, who served as senior vice-president of communications and public policy at Google for several years before departing for Uber, she wrote: \u201cIt seems like we believe in free expression except when people disagree with the majority view \u2026 I have lost count of the times at Google, for example, people tell me privately that they cannot admit their voting choice if they are Republican because they fear how other Googlers react.\u201d  The complaint argues that Google\u2019s tolerance for \u201calternative lifestyles\u201d \u2013 the company has internal mailing lists for people interested in \u201cfurries, polygamy, transgenderism, and plurality\u201d \u2013 does not extend to conservatism. One employee who emailed a list seeking parenting advice related to imparting a child with \u201ctraditional gender roles and patriarchy from a very young age\u201d was allegedly chastised by human resources. The suit also alleges that Google maintains a \u201csecret\u201d blacklist of conservative authors who are banned from being on campus. Curtis Yarvin, a \u201cneoreactionary\u201d who blogs under the name Mencius Moldbug, was allegedly removed from the campus by security after being invited to lunch. The plaintiffs subsequently learned, it is claimed in the suit, that Alex Jones, the InfoWars conspiracy theorist, and Theodore Beale, an \u201calt-right\u201d blogger known as VoxDay, were also banned from the campus. The suit will likely reignite the culture wars that have swirled around the tech industry since the election of Donald Trump. Many liberals within the tech industry have pressured their employers to take a stand against Trump policies, such as the Muslim travel ban, and companies have struggled to decide the extent to which they will allow the resurgent movement of white nationalists to use their platforms to organize.  Damore\u2019s firing in August last year was heavily covered by the rightwing media, which portrayed the saga as evidence of Silicon Valley\u2019s liberal bias, and the engineer was transformed into a political martyr by prominent members of the \u201calt-right\u201d. In making its case against Google, the suit reveals some of the internal backlash Damore received after his memo went viral, including a mass email in which a Google director called the memo \u201crepulsive and intellectually dishonest\u201d and an email to Damore from a fellow engineer stating: \u201cI will keep hounding you until one of us is fired.\u201d  Gudeman, the second named plaintiff, was fired following a post-election controversy in another online forum at Google. A Google employee posted that he was concerned for his safety under a Trump administration because he had already been \u201ctargeted by the FBI (including at work) for being a Muslim\u201d. According to the suit, Gudeman responded skeptically to the comment, raising questions about the FBI\u2019s motives for investigating the employee, and was reported to HR. Gudeman was fired shortly thereafter, the suit claims, after Google HR told him that he had \u201caccused [the Muslim employee] of terrorism\u201d.
