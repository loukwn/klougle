Last Saturday, Reece scored the only goal in Ards\u2019 1-0 win over Ballymena, firing past his elder brother. Is this the first time a goalkeeper has been beaten by his own brother in a competitive match (discounting own goals)?\u201d Pete Tomlin can help. \u201cI know that, on 9 March 1974, Everton striker Bob Latchford scored twice past his older brother David Latchford, who was playing in goal for Birmingham. Interestingly, there was a third Latchford brother, the youngest Peter, who was also a goalkeeper, playing for West Brom and Celtic. If you are interested, I came across a photo of Bob scoring one of his goals past his big bro.\u201d We are interested, Pete. We\u2019re also interested in this nugget of information provided by Stephan Wijnen: \u201cIn the 2009-10 Dutch Eerste Divisie (second division) play-offs for promotion, FC Eindhoven played Willem II in the semi-finals. Defender Arjan Swinkels (the older brother) played for Willem II and goalkeeper Ruud Swinkels played for FC Eindhoven. In the first leg in Eindhoven (on 6 May 2010), Arjan scored the winning goal (1-2) by heading past Ruud in the 80th minute. \u201cBy the way, in the second leg in Tilburg (on 9 May 2010, 1-1), Arjan did not score, but he did receive a yellow card (22nd minute). Ruud managed to top that however, by receiving a straight red card in the 81st minute.\u201d \u201cIn the Reading v Stevenage FA Cup game, Reading had to change kit halfway through because of a clash,\u201d mails Paul Savage. \u201cReading changed into their away kit, despite being the home side. Has this happened before?\u201d \u201cIn 2000-01,\u201d begins Denis Hurley. \u201cUefa was still trying to enforce a rule where the home team changed kit in the event of a clash in the Champions League. When Arsenal hosted Sparta Prague at Highbury, they opted to wear their new navy third kit but it proved problematic against the dark maroon of Sparta and so Arsenal switched to their yellow away shirts at half-time. \u201cIn the League of Ireland in 2012, Cork City hosted Dundalk in very heavy rain and at half-time both teams changed into their away shirts. Dundalk had, for some reason, begun the game wearing their yellow away socks, so the change made their overall kit look better.\u201d Grantham Town kindly got in touch to raise the bar, mind, with regards their 2012 game against Witton Albion: @TheKnowledge_GU Re: This week's column 'can you help?' - in 2012 we beat @wittonalbionfc 2-0 on a day where they wore THREE different kits in the same 90 minutes - https://t.co/2HhDd2sOCx Last week we included a few examples of owners who thought they could do a much better job of things than their managers, so gave themselves the job. Naturally, we missed a few. \u201cGraham Turner was chairman, team manager and majority shareholder of Hereford United from 1998 until the end of the 2009\u201310 season,\u201d writes Paul Sheath. \u201cGaining promotion from the Conference in 2006 and promotion from League Two the following year, he was voted League Two manager of the year. He managed 742 games at Hereford United.\u201d Peter Johnson has been on: \u201cFC Sion owner and president Christian Constant has a track record of sacking a long list of managers, and at one time appointed himself when there was no \u2018suitable\u2019 candidate. He also made headlines recently for physically attacking a TV pundit.\u201d \u201cYou missed Marc White of Dorking Wanderers, currently in the Isthmian (Bostick) Premier,\u201d points out Ian Ditchfield. \u201cHe\u2019s not just owner and manager, he\u2019s also founder and chief financier. The club really is his creation, although pleasingly he lacks the arrogance of some others in your article. From park football to seventh tier in 18 years is no mean achievement.\u201d And here\u2019s Sean DeLoughry: \u201cWe have to throw Mick Wallace and Wexford Youths into the mix. As this Guardian article from 2009 suggests, founder-owner-sponsor-manager-agent would be a better description in the early days of Wallace\u2019s Wexford Youths project when they competed in the League of Ireland\u2019s second tier. Wexford are still going strong since Wallace took a step away. He\u2019s now a TD (Irish equivalent of MP), while the renamed Wexford FC are back in the second tier after a single season in the top flight.\u201d \u201cI was idly leafing through a reference book the other day and came across a reference to Third Lanark doing something (getting relegated, I think) in 1965. This surprised me as I had always taken that name to be rather like The Wanderers in England \u2013 a name in the early records, but long out of existence. What happened to them?\u201d asked Alan Cooper, the very first question in the very first Knowledge. As you suspected, Third Lanark were relegated at the end of the 1964-65 Scottish First Division campaign, losing a spectacular 30 of their 34 matches and ending up with seven points. Sadly, within two years, the club was declared bankrupt, thrown out of the league, and dissolved in the courts. Just how the club ended up like that was never properly ascertained \u2013 fans still claim boardroom corruption to this day \u2013 but the net result was plain enough, and the death knell sounded after a 2-2 draw away at Stranraer in 1967. It was a sorry end to the scarlet-shirted Glasgow club, which had enjoyed no little success in the early years of Scottish football. The Third Lanarkshire Volunteers \u2013 also known as Third Lanark, Thirds, the Warriors, and the Hi-Hi \u2013 were founder members of the Scottish League, and won the championship in 1904 and the Scottish Cup in 1889 and 1905 (beating Celtic and Rangers, respectively). @TheKnowledge_GU as the transfer window hits up we\u2019ve seen Man Utd launch the Alexis Sanchez \u2018Piano\u2019 video but does anyone beat #bcafc COO @JamesMason_78 waiting at a bus stop? What is the oddest location for the announcement of a new signing? https://t.co/2vO8CeXNNN \u201cWhich player has picked up the most yellow cards for shirt removal?\u201d asks Jonny Mac. \u201cWith George Weah now president of Liberia, Milan boast quite the list of alumni who\u2019ve been involved in politics in some way,\u201d begins Michael Sheen. \u201cAs well as reclusive owner Silvio Berlusconi, Gianni Rivera became an MP and then an MEP, and Kakha Kaladze was a Georgian MP, deputy PM and now major of Tbilisi. And that\u2019s before you factor in players who hold political roles in the well-fed world of football administration (Zvonomir Boban is Fifa deputy secretary general, Dejan Savicevic is head of the Montenegrin FA and Demetrio Albertini is VP of the Italian FA). Can anyone beat that for political football?\u201d \u201cThe teams scrapping to avoid relegation from Guam Soccer League\u2019s Premier Division include FC Beercelona and Pago Bay Disasters. Is there a team anywhere that has a more ill-starred name than Pago Bay Disasters? Also, is there another top division team anywhere with a pun-based name?\u201d asks K\u00e1ri Tulinius. With Chester FC in dire trouble, I was wondering how many fan-started phoenix clubs have gone bust? The only one to come up so far is Ilkeston:Ilkeston Town FC went bust in 2011Ilkeston FC went bust in 2017", "title": "Footballers scoring past their siblings in competitive matches | The Knowledge"}
