It was a must-win game in Eindhoven and hopes of progress into the Champions League knockout phase now hang by a thread. Vorm conceded he and his teammates had rolled out a similar line after the opening match of the group phase at Internazionale, when they blew a 1-0 lead to lose 2-1. He did not mention Juventus in the last 16 of the competition last season, when they blew a 1-0 lead inside three second\u2011half minutes to lose 2-1 in the second leg to be eliminated. \u201cWe always say to each other: \u2018We need to learn from this, we need to learn from that,\u2019\u201d Vorm said. What he left unsaid practically screamed at his audience \u2013 Spurs have not learned. And it is eating them up. \u201cThen, if it [a bad result] happens, I think it kills the team as well,\u201d Vorm added. The back-up goalkeeper came on at PSV after Hugo Lloris\u2019s 79th-minute sending off. Up to that point Spurs were almost ridiculously comfortable; complacently comfortable perhaps. Vorm made a good save to keep out a Luuk de Jong free-kick but the tide turned sharply and the 10 men could not hold out. De Jong would score the equaliser with three minutes to go. \u201cIf you see the statistics after the game, it says it all,\u201d Vorm said, referring to Spurs\u2019s domination of the ball and their 24 shots to PSV\u2019s 11. \u201cIf we\u2019d have won 4-1 or 5-1, it would have been deserved. And that makes it even harder, because now it feels like we lost. We had to kill the game but it\u2019s something you don\u2019t even have to talk about. We know that, especially in European games.\u201d Tottenham know but they could not do anything about it and what shone through in Vorm\u2019s comments was the sense of frustration and helpless bewilderment. What is the solution? \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a difficult one \u2013 if there really was a solution, to say: \u2018If we do this, if we do that,\u2019\u201d he replied. Vorm was asked whether Tottenham need to unlock something, possibly by winning a trophy, to fortify them. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing on the pitch you don\u2019t think about these kind of things. But you also know how long it takes. \u201cFrom the bench, we thought: \u2018We need to score the third.\u2019 Everybody knows, everybody wants to score. But you also know that the opponent is always ready to come out on the counterattack, especially with the way PSV were playing. I can\u2019t say: \u2018This is it,\u2019 or \u2018This is it.\u2019 It\u2019s just a shame. We need to learn from it.\u201d What Spurs have learned is that the Champions League is a completely different game to domestic football. Eric Dier had talked about that before the match. \u201cPlaying teams from different countries, different styles of play, different atmospheres \u2013 I think the refereeing style can be different at times, as well,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of things to adjust to.\u201d It is jarring to see how quickly matches at this most rarefied level can turn. Control can be wrested from one team by a single action. Errors are punished without pity. On the other hand, luck also comes into it \u2013 refereeing decisions for example. Over a 38-game Premier League season, that tends to even itself out. In the Champions League, it can pack a harder punch. Is the problem to do with Tottenham\u2019s mentality? Their Spursiness, to use the dreaded word? Mauricio Pochettino made no attempt to disguise his frustration at how they had taken their foot off the pedal in the closing stages, slowing the tempo and losing their aggression in attack. It seemed as though he was accusing them of showboating. \u201cOne season is not the other,\u201d Vorm said. \u201cOne season doesn\u2019t mean that the next season will be better or similar. Obviously, you play different opponents. European football is just totally different from the Premier League. We\u2019re still in a process of learning in these kind of games. It\u2019s harsh though.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/25/tottenham-michel-vorm-psv"}
