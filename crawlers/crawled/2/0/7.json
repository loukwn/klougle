In Portugal, the Ta\u00e7a da Liga, the national cup, came alive before kick-off, with cardboard boxes dancing away before the match ball was delivered in an unimaginable showboating style. It certainly gives this, hardly mundane delivery in May a run for its money. 2) Bend It Like Beckham? Bend It Like Emile Smith-Rowe. An outstanding effort into the top corner from the young Arsenal midfielder. Talking of the sublime, how about some Neymar slapstick, with the Paris Saint-Germain star opting to control the ball on his back, on this occasion, but this, against Hamari Traor\u00e9 was rather sneaky, wasn\u2019t it? Or Ricardinho, just doing his thing. And with the sublime, must go the ridiculous: feel free to make your own jokes when we tell you that this bloke\u2019s name is Dodo. 3) Houston sports radio hosts lose the run of themselves quite significantly. 4) With seconds to go, witness the feel-good factor on court at Evanston Township High School in Illinois. 5) And Straubing Tigers ice hockey player Stefan Loibl is giving a casual half-time interview when Der Eismaschine attacks. 1) The Andre the Giant documentary trailer is here. And here he is on Letterman. 2) Lyth and Finch team up for a first amazing catch. And a second one! 3) But a groundsman shows them how it\u2019s really done. Plus some comedy here. 4) Dunks? Dunks!
