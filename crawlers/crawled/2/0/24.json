The Games chief, Lee Hee-beom, said preparations for the first Winter Olympics in Asia outside Japan were complete with athletes arriving in the South Korean town. \u201cWe are fully operational with many of our athletes and officials here and settling into their life in the villages and training is under way at all venues,\u201d Lee told a news conference.  But he said 1,200 private security staff have been sidelined as fear of a norovirus among some of them has forced organisers to replace them with military personnel pending medical tests. The virus is highly contagious and causes vomiting and stomach cramps among other symptoms. Athletes from several countries were taken ill and some were forced to miss competitions at last year\u2019s world athletics championship in London when the virus was found to have spread through one hotel.  \u201cAs a president of Pocog [the organising committee], I would like to apologise for this,\u201d Lee said. \u201cOur disease control centre and other related government agencies here are now discussing countermeasures and will come up with proper measures and will be announced soon.\u201d  Lee said this would have no effect on security arrangements at the Games, held about 80km south of the border with North Korea, with whom South Korea has technically been at war since 1953. The cold weather, however, could be an issue for organisers with the opening ceremony in the open-air Olympic stadium expected to be freezing. Temperatures are currently below freezing throughout the day, dropping to as low as minus 21 degrees Celsius at night. Lee said some fans will not attend the opening ceremony despite having bought tickets, while some competitions could be affected.  \u201cSome have cancelled their ticket for the opening ceremony,\u201d Lee said. \u201cRegarding the potential of the delay due to the weather, the International Olympic Committee and the international federation have strict rules, for example, ski jumping can not take place if there\u2019s a strong wind.  \u201cWe are now installing wind screens at the venue. Despite our efforts and if there is a strong wind, the event can be delayed but the decision won\u2019t be made by me, it will be made by IOC and the federation.\u201d  Lee said a special bag with hot packs, seatwarmers, a blanket, a hat and a windbreaker would be distributed to spectators in an effort to keep them warm at the start of what could turn out to be the coldest winter Olympics in decades.", "title": "Winter Olympics: 1,200 security staff sidelined after norovirus outbreak"}
