Barely 12 hours after firing the Philadelphia Eagles to a sensational 41-33 victory over New England \u2013 in which he threw for three touchdowns and caught another \u2013 he stood on a podium and told reporters that this noted individual prize was actually a team one.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a great honour to be up here and accept this on behalf of the Philadelphia Eagles,\u201d said Foles. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to be part of a great team, great players, great coaching staff and I think just the play of the last couple of weeks was just a team thing. We kept working, kept game-planning, kept talking to [head coach] Doug [Pederson] about what I liked, and him and all the coaching staff kept building it around what we were doing. \u201cAnd then it was just a reflection of the execution on the field, and pulling for one another just like we have been all year. So, in that it wasn\u2019t necessarily me, it was everyone around me that did an amazing job.\u201d Just another media-trained athlete demonstrating a little false humility? From another player you might believe it, but not Foles.  This is a man with the opportunity now to transform his life, a backup who appeared to be locked into a career of playing second fiddle despite one previous Pro Bowl season in Philadelphia, but who now will be sought for trade by teams eager to make him their starter \u2013 and to pay him a salary commensurate with that role. And yet, when was asked about the prospect, Foles hinted that he might countenance another year as the Eagles\u2019 backup.  \u201cI\u2019m not worried about my future right now, there\u2019ll be a time and a place to handle all that,\u201d said Foles. \u201cBut I take a lot of pride in wearing the Philadelphia Eagles jersey. And I just enjoy being here. Such a great team, I\u2019m excited for Carson Wentz, coming back healthy. I get to work with him every day. Dude\u2019s a stud. And, you know, I\u2019m just living in the moment.\u201d It is not uncommon for Super Bowl MVPs to show up for these morning-after press conferences, conducted at 8.30am, to show up looking a little bleary-eyed. Not Foles. He claimed to be \u201crunning on fumes\u201d, but if so it was not showing. He acknowledged that he had slipped away from the team\u2019s celebration early to be with his family. Rather than glory in this victory, indeed, he was keen to talk about harder times. \u201cI think the big thing [to tell people] is \u2018don\u2019t be afraid to fail\u2019. I think in our society today, you know, Instagram, Twitter, it\u2019s a highlight reel. It\u2019s all the good things. Then when you look at it, then you think like, \u2018wow\u2019, when you had a rough day or your life\u2019s not as good as that, you\u2019re failing.  \u201cAnd failure\u2019s a part of life, that\u2019s a part of building character, and growing. Without failure, who would you be? I wouldn\u2019t be up here if I hadn\u2019t fallen a thousand times, made mistakes. We all are human, we have weaknesses, and throughout this being able to share that and be transparent. \u201cI know that when I listen to people speak, and they share their weaknesses, I\u2019m listening because I can resonate. So, I\u2019m not perfect, I\u2019m not Superman. I might be in the NFL, and we might have just won the Super Bowl, but I still have daily struggles \u2026 And that\u2019s really just been the message, simple. If something\u2019s going on in your life and you\u2019re struggling, embrace it, because you\u2019re growing.\u201d Doug Pederson followed Foles at the podium, and he too preached a message of teamwork and collective achievement. Asked how he had seen Foles change since taking on the starting role, the Eagles head coach suggested that the quarterback was still very much the same grounded individual he had first got to know as a rookie back in 2012. \u201cI have a lot of guys like Nick on that roster,\u201d observed Pederson. \u201cThese guys helped us win this game.\u201d That he and Foles have enjoyed working together is plain. For all the warm words, though, the likelihood remains that they will not do so next season.  \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t get off this stage without that question!\u201d joked Pederson when his turn to discuss the player\u2019s future arrived. \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re just going to enjoy this moment. I\u2019m going to tell you right now we\u2019re going to enjoy it, get on a plane, go back to Philadelphia, celebrate with our fans back in Philly.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long offseason. Well, really it\u2019s a short offseason now. [But] we\u2019re just going to enjoy this moment. I\u2019m happy for Nick, I\u2019m happy for the team, it\u2019s not about one guy, it\u2019s about the team. Like I said, we\u2019re going to enjoy these next few days.\u201d Like Foles, though, he did also spare a thought for the quarterback who had started Philadelphia\u2019s first 13 games of the season, playing at an MVP level himself before blowing out his ACL. \u201cI had a chance to talk to Carson on the field, on the podium last night after the game,\u201d said Pederson. \u201cI just told him to take this in, just enjoy this moment.  \u201cHe\u2019s a great quarterback and I told him you\u2019re a big, big part of why this team won this championship and won this game. And I told him that hopefully we\u2019ll be back in this game with him leading the way.\u201d", "title": "'I have daily struggles': Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles reflective after victory"}
