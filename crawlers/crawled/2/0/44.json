Manchester United are keen on the PSV winger Steven Bergwijn but may face competition from Liverpool for the pacy 21-year-old. Liverpool could be distracted as they, according to the Star, are \u201cpreparing an offer for Hoffenheim midfielder Kerem Demirbay\u201d. Olivier Giroud has played in all but one of Chelsea\u2019s league games so far, starting four of them, but even so West Ham think he may be available in the new year. According to the Mirror, the player\u2019s contract ends in the summer and unless he is offered a new one the Hammers, turned down by the Frenchman while he was still at Arsenal, \u201ccould try again in January\u201d.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/18/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-messi-reunion-barcelona"}
