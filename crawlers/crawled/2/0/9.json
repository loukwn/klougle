During Liverpool\u2019s drama-tastic draw against Tottenham, assistant referee Eddie Smart had, Gallagher insisted, \u201ccovered himself in glory\u201d, getting all the important decisions bang-on. But if the eagle-eyed flag-flutterer left Anfield with his head held high, others were a little more bemused. \u201cThe first penalty, it was one of the clearest offside situations I have seen,\u201d growled J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a new rule. Is there? When the ball left the foot of the Tottenham player, Harry Kane is offside. This situation has never changed. My defence put Kane offside, that\u2019s good defending. At the end I\u2019ve learned something new and now people will think I know nothing about football because I thought it was offside.\u201d Well the rule is not exactly new, having been in place since the 2013-14 season, but for many \u2013 Klopp included \u2013 this is the first time they have realised its true implications. Before 2013, Fifa admitted, the wording of the offside law gave \u201ctoo much room for interpretation\u201d and was \u201cnot precise enough\u201d. \u201cThe new text,\u201d it announced, \u201cis more in line with actual game situations and will eliminate the confusion surrounding what is meant by rebound, deflection and when the ball has been deliberately saved.\u201d The updated wording \u2013 or at least the bit of it that interests us \u2013 goes as follows: \u201cA player in an offside position receiving the ball from an opponent who deliberately plays the ball (except from a deliberate save by any opponent) is not considered to have gained an advantage.\u201d So now we see that Fifa skilfully \u201celiminated the confusion surrounding what is meant by rebound, deflection and when the ball has been deliberately saved\u201d by creating brand new confusion surrounding what is meant by \u201cdeliberate\u201d, \u201cplays\u201d, and \u201csurely this isn\u2019t actually an actual law of actual football?\u201d We\u2019re considering here the buildup to Tottenham\u2019s first penalty, the one that Loris Karius saved. The ball was played through to Kane by Dele Alli. Dejan Lovren made a desperate attempt to cut it out, wildly flinging a leg at it but getting no more than the slightest contact as it bounced through to the Spurs striker, who then prodded it past Karius and collapsed like a half-baked souffl\u00e9. But Lovren was trying to play the ball, and the ball did touch him, and he therefore deliberately played it \u2013 even if, in trying to, he accidentally miskicked it horribly. The instant the ball skimmed off his scything shin a new phase of play commenced and the obviously offside forward lurking a couple of yards behind him was suddenly rendered onside. So Smart\u2019s reading of the situation was right, even if everything else about the incident was the wrongest kind of wrong. It was clear to all those fortunate enough to witness it that Sunday\u2019s 2-2 draw was thrilling, breathless, dizzying madness of the most glorious sort, but in the name of custard, parrots and all that is good in this world can somebody please re-rephrase this offside law post-haste?

Ferg Slade\u2019s Peter Odemwingie\u2019s reference (albeit dated) is exactly the sort of needless energy and disappointment I was alluding too. As a Palace fan, the suggestion Ibrahim Amadou bought a one-way ticket on Eurostar only to return to Lille without his \u2018dream move\u2019 to south London unfulfilled might however put him ahead of all of us in the disappointment and wasted effort stakes\u201d \u2013 Greg Grimmer.
