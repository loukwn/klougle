Childhood obesity is at record levels. Fewer than a quarter of children meet minimum daily physical activity recommendations. The latest Office for National Statistics research shows girls still spend almost half the time boys do taking part in sport and are less likely to be involved in sport at all, with 38.8% of boys doing sport daily, compared with 26.4% of girls. But while the research continues to highlight the extent of the problem, all are grappling with how to do something about it. The Arsenal and Scotland player Lisa Evans believes using new technology to target teenagers is vital to increasing the profile of women in sport: \u201cSocial media is taking over and is the biggest thing out there for attracting people to anything \u2013 be it news, sport or entertainment. Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, they\u2019re the growth markets for teenagers. So using them is one way we get to the age group we are targeting and hopefully can encourage them to play football.\u201d Evans is speaking after beginning a vlogging series for Uefa\u2019s YouTube channel, Together #WePlayStrong alongside Basel\u2019s German striker Eunice Beckmann and the Austrian internationals Sarah Zadrazil and Laura Feiersinger, who play for the German clubs Turbine Potsdam and Sand respectively. The four friends film their day-to-day lives, from training to grocery shopping, to give an insight into life as professional female athletes. Evans played for Glasgow City then moved to Germany with Turbine Potsdam and Bayern Munich before joining Arsenal in 2017. Recruited by their former manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, she is now filming a flavour of life at Arsenal under the new manager, Joe Montemurro. \u201cI\u2019m loving it so far. I love Joe, I think he\u2019s great, no disrespect to Pedro \u2013 he\u2019s obviously the one who brought me to the club \u2013 but I think Joe is going to take us to that next level,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s got a relaxed approach to football, his coaching style is relaxed and he likes to play possession-based football. For us as a team and a club, it\u2019s the Arsenal way. It\u2019s how we like to play football.\u201d Having played at the top level in Germany, the 25-year-old has seen the benefits of the German approach to sports. \u201cThere\u2019s higher participation in Germany across all sports, whether that be football or hockey or whatever, they\u2019ve got it from a young age. There\u2019s a whole different attitude towards the game there.\u201d Evans was part of the Scotland team which played in its first European Championship finals in the summer and the benefits of a team environment stick out for her. \u201cI think any sport in general, whether it\u2019s professional or amateur, gives you opportunities to be around people, be in a team environment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more like that in the women\u2019s game as a whole. The men\u2019s is much more about the individual now, but in women\u2019s it\u2019s all about team cohesion. That\u2019s what\u2019s so great about the vlog. It\u2019s about four friends from different countries and different backgrounds who have all played together and now gone their separate ways.\u201d Beckmann, who played in the US and Germany before she moved to Basel, where she has 12 goals in 12 games, has experienced football in the two biggest women\u2019s footballing nations. \u201cIn America men\u2019s football isn\u2019t as big as men\u2019s football in Europe. The women\u2019s national team is more successful than the men\u2019s national team and that\u2019s why girls over there are more inspired by the US women\u2019s team,\u201d she explains. \u201cI played a regular game in Portland and I think there were over 20,000 in the stadium. I\u2019ve never played in front of so many people.\u201d The weekly series is three weeks in and has attracted between 200,000 to 700,000 views per episode. Uefa is clearly hoping it can tap into the rise of the YouTube star and its slick cartoon graphics flit across the playful, Snapchat-esque amateur footage by the players. \u201cI\u2019ve been vlogging pretty much every day,\u201d says Beckmann, who at one point balances the camera in her kitchen as she talks through making some cinnamon-heavy protein pancakes. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying it. Sometimes it\u2019s exhausting but every day I get more and more comfortable with the camera. I wouldn\u2019t have imagined it being as much fun as it has been. The camera is my best friend right now.\u201d \u2022 Last year\u2019s FA Cup finalists, Manchester City and Birmingham, have been drawn against each other in the last 16 of this year\u2019s competition. The final takes place at Wembley on 5 May. The fifth round draw: Arsenal v Millwall, Cardiff City v Charlton Athletic, Lewes v Everton, Sunderland v Aston Villa, Chichester City v Liverpool, Birmingham City v Manchester City, Chelsea v Doncaster Rovers Belles, Durham v Plymouth Argyle or Leicester City. \u2022 Having initially been scheduled to take place days after an international break, the Continental Cup final between Arsenal and Manchester City has been moved to Wednesday 14 March at Wycombe Wanderers\u2019 Adams Park. \u2022 The Norway international Andrine Hegerberg has left Birmingham City for Paris St-Germain. The 24-year-old joined Blues in 2016 and has been playing for her country since 2013. Hegerberg said: \u201cParis Saint-Germain is a wonderful new step in my career. It\u2019s one of the best clubs in the world.\u201d \u2022 Liverpool Ladies captain, Gemma Bonner, has been ruled out for two to three months having suffered ankle ligament damage in her side\u2019s 2-0 league win over Bristol City. Manchester City\u2019s captain Steph Houghton and goalkeeper Karen Bardsley sustained injuries during the league leaders\u2019 0-0 draw against Chelsea at Kingsmeadow last week. The extent of their injuries is yet to be confirmed. \u2022 Perth Glory may have missed out on the chance to compete for a W-League Grand Final spot but their striker Sam Kerr has been confirmed as the league\u2019s golden boot winner having scored 13 goals in nine games in the regular season. The Finals Series pits Sydney FC against Newcastle Jets before Brisbane Roar take on Melbourne City, all going for a place in the Grand Final. \u2022 The dates of the Champions League quarter-final matches have been confirmed. In the first legs Manchester City host the Swedish side Link\u00f6ping and Montpellier host Chelsea on 21 March. Wolfsburg are at home to Slavia Prague and Lyon host Barcelona on 22 March. The second legs will take place on 28 March.", "title": "Arsenal\u2019s Lisa Evans launches scheme to get more women playing football"}
