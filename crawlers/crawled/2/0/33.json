It means the men in red will again have 10 Scarlets in their ranks as they strive to become the first team to beat England at Twickenham in the Six Nations since Scott Williams\u2019s try put Warren Gatland\u2019s team on course for the grand slam in 2012. The only change to the 23 who featured in the 34-7 victory over Scotland last weekend is North\u2019s inclusion on the bench in place of the inexperienced Ospreys\u2019 centre Owen Watkin. There is no place for the Saracens wing Liam Williams who returned to training this week after missing the opening round with an abdominal strain. \u201cIt is tough on Owen, but Josh Adams (the Worcester wing who made his Test debut against Scotland) picked up a slight strain last weekend so George provides a bit more cover there,\u201d said Gatland, the Wales head coach, who will also have the option of bringing on North in the midfield to add thrust. \u201cWe know how tough it is going to be against a huge English forward pack. They are really going to test us. England have been in great form the last couple of years so we know the challenge we face but we have had a good couple of weeks in camp and we are looking forward to going up to Twickenham. The players deserve an unchanged side after the performance on the weekend.\u201d Wales have not beaten England in the Six Nations since 2013, the year when they pipped their grand slam chasing rivals to the title with a 30-3 victory in Cardiff to deny them on points difference. Their side contains three survivors from the starting line-up at Twickenham, Leigh Halfpenny, Ken Owens and Alun Wyn Jones, while Williams came off the bench for the second-half. A fifth successive victory for England would equal their tournament record over Wales having on three occasions achieved the feat, the last time between 2000 and 2004. Wales XV L Halfpenny (Scarlets, left); J Adams (Worcs), S Williams, H Parkes, S Evans; R Patchell, G Davies; R Evans, K Owens, S Lee (all Scarlets), C Hill (Dragons), AW Jones (Ospreys, capt), A Shingler (Scarlets), J Navidi (Cardiff Blues), R Moriarty (Gloucs). Replacements E Dee (Dragons), W Jones (Scarlets), T Francis (Exeter), B Davies (Ospreys), J Tipuric (Ospreys), A Davies (Scarlets), G Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), G North (Northampton).
