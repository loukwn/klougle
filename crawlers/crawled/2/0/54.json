Reluctant to provide his services as a water-taxi for fear of being fatally stung, the frog finally relents when the scorpion points out that if he did so, both creatures will drown. Halfway across the river, the scorpion stings him anyway and when the dying frog asks why, the unapologetic arachnid looks him straight in his googly eyes and says: \u201cLads, it\u2019s Tottenham.\u201d Of course, the moral of the story is that certain natures cannot be reformed no matter how hard you try and while you can take a 2-1 lead against a vastly inferior Eredivisie side in a must-win Big Cup game, it seems you just can\u2019t take the \u201cLads, it\u2019s Tottenham\u201d out of Spurs. Completely in control of a game against PSV Eindhoven, in which they missed enough chances to win several matches, the London club\u2019s fabled flakiness prevailed and they somehow summoned their inner Spurs to draw a game it seemed inconceivable they might not win with just 10 minutes to go. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win this type of game then it is difficult to deserve to qualify,\u201d sighed their crestfallen manager, Mauricio Pochettino, idly plucking the slender thread by which his team\u2019s hopes of progressing to the knockout stages of Big Cup currently hang. \u201cWe completely dominated and we had the chances to kill the game. We need to be more aggressive and score more than two because you can always concede when the result is tight.\u201d The question now for Spurs is whether they should bin off any attempt to drop into Big Vase (a trophy they could actually win), to focus on qualifying for next season\u2019s Big Cup (one they almost certainly won\u2019t). For all the bouquets that have been lobbed his way, the very likable Pochettino has yet to take that bare look off Spurs\u2019 trophy cabinet after more than four years in charge. The grand opening of a big shop outside their sw@nky new stadium earlier this week is unlikely to appease the fans for too long either. Of course, it behoves The Fiver to mention that, if they win their remaining three Big Cup group games, they could still scrape through to the knockout stages in the event of a total collapse by Inter. The kind of collapse that seems so unlikely you can\u2019t imagine it befalling anyone other than vintage Spurs. Join Michael Butler from 5.55pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Sporting 1-2 Arsenal, while Simon Burnton will be on hand for Chelsea 2-0 Bate at 8pm, along with Niall McVeigh for the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers 1-1 Spartak Moscow. \u201cI\u2019d be Manchester United, I\u2019d sign myself, I would score loads and we\u2019d win everything. It sounds a bit weird but the thing is I was great in it!\u201d \u2013 Championship Manager legend Cherno Samba talks to David Hytner about the game, but also how he bounced back after his career and life fell apart. An extra dose of Football Weekly, you say? Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t. If you value our journalism, please support us. In return we can hopefully arm you with the kind of knowledge that makes you sound slightly less uninformed during those hot reactive gegenpress chats you so enjoy. And if you think what we do is enjoyable [again, etc and so on \u2013 Fiver Ed], please help us keep coming back here to give you more of the same. \u201cHey! \u2018Unheard-of outfits\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). Back then we barely lost to Benfica in the second round\u201d \u2013 AGF Aarhus. \u201cPerhaps this is the antidote to the problem of modern football highlighted by Bruce Jamieson (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters)\u201c \u2013 Michael Friel. \u201cModern football \u2026 not always rubbish\u201d \u2013 John De la Cruz. \u201cSurely the story about Christian T1tz should have been in Bits and Boo [Snip \u2013 Fiver Ed]\u201d \u2013 Andy Korman. \u201cI was pleasantly shocked to see my name mentioned in yesterday\u2019s Fiver, as it\u2019s not one I\u2019ve used in around two years since getting married. I\u2019m still around, occasionally contributing under my new name, and lamenting the geographical misfortune of growing up in Kent and supporting the local team. Hopefully this sets any mildly inquiring minds to rest\u201d \u2013 James Vortkamp-Tong. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 AGF Aarhus. J\u00fcrgen Klopp reckons Mo Salah has silenced any doubters over his form after setting a new record with two goals in the 4-0 win over Red Star Belgrade. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we can maybe stop talking about that,\u201d he tooted. Barcelona and Inter are presumably both still celebrating Spurs\u2019 ineptitude despite the former winning their Camp Nou meeting 2-0. While PSG were just about digging their way out of a Napoli-shaped hole in Paris, Dortmund put a beatdown on Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Here\u2019s your Big Cup review. Fifa\u2019s world rankings are out, with Belgium at No 1, England at No 5 and Gibraltar rising to a best of 190. Somehow, Scotland are 40th. Football League big dog Shaun Harvey wants a review of the ban on fans partaking in booze during games. \u201cTo have a blanket ban on alcohol in view of the playing area in 2018 is, in our view, disproportionate to today\u2019s level of risk,\u201d he cheered. The Championship continues to be the Championship. One of those b@ntzy blokes off YouTube has been allowed to host Eleven Sports\u2019 coverage of \u201cThe El Cl\u00e1sico\u201d. And the TV cameras will also be heading to Maidenhead, Port Vale, Haringey and Hampton & Richmond for this year\u2019s live FA Cup first-round coverage.
