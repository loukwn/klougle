In fact, it is extremely encouraging because it demonstrates the amount of ownership taken by George Ford and Owen Farrell. He has talked before about how they \u201ccan\u2019t be coached\u201d \u2013 that effectively they coach themselves \u2013 but increasingly it looks as if they are taking a firm handle on running the back division. You can see it when they line up together and it was really quite obvious against Italy. Farrell is vastly experienced and Ford is a lot more experienced than you might think too. They\u2019re not new to the Test match or Six Nations environment, or to each other and they have such a good understanding of what makes the back-line unit tick. It\u2019s something you get at club level \u2013 senior players who have been around a while know what makes things tick and it\u2019s very powerful when you have that. I\u2019m the other side of it now. I don\u2019t want to be standing there talking and yelling at every backs session, telling them what to do. If you get an ownership from the players and they understand the expectations \u2013 if it\u2019s player led, that\u2019s very powerful and I\u2019m sure at Test level it\u2019s even more powerful. It puts England in a very good place. You\u2019ve got your leaders of the game: if they\u2019re doing it at training as well, it makes for a slick operation. You get the transfer from what you\u2019re doing at training because there\u2019s a massive buy-in and everyone feeds off that. Against Italy I thought the variety from the two of them was really good. It wasn\u2019t just going side to side, they played the front line, they were very patient. They really manipulated Italy in defence and shortened them up \u2013 that is the beauty of having that Ford-Farrell combination because you have another 10 to see that space and when it\u2019s on in the wider channels. Then you\u2019ve got the strike runners who are deadly when in space, as we saw with Anthony Watson\u2019s two tries after Ford and Farrell had combined. They both used the forwards really well too. It all comes down to the work England are doing at the contact area \u2013 it becomes a lot easier to make decisions because you have a lot of time. If you\u2019re getting that front-foot ball and the ruck speed you want, a combination at 10-12 or 9-10-12, you\u2019ll see a really quick progression and a quick understanding of what each player wants and needs and what their strengths and weaknesses are. What you\u2019re seeing when they get that front-foot ball is Ford can be really flat and Farrell can punch and make line breaks off it. It allows Ford to play on that front line and Farrell in that second wave. He\u2019s played 10 a lot so he has the ability and the awareness. He knows the appropriate depth he needs when he\u2019s playing out the back. He can read the defensive line in those wide channels and he knows when to play the front line as well. Wales will be an altogether different challenge because defensively they were extremely strong against a Scotland side who were very confident after their autumn performances \u2013 Shaun Edwards will be very pleased. And I was hugely impressed with the way Wales\u2019s big Scarlets contingent performed, especially Scott Williams and Hadleigh Parkes in the centres. Part of me felt it would be difficult to translate their Champions Cup form to a tournament but they were fantastic. They\u2019ve got a bulk of a Scarlets squad there that know how to play that style of rugby but the big difference at Twickenham will be whether they can get parity at the set piece and have a platform. If the England defence can stop Wales behind the gainline, do Warren Gatland\u2019s players have the ability to manipulate and get that go-forward ball? If they don\u2019t, it looks great passing from side to side but they are not going anywhere. Eventually the pressure comes on, someone gets isolated and England will feed off that. When I saw Jonathan Sexton line up the drop-goal, I couldn\u2019t help but think it was too far back. A drop-goal on its own is an extremely difficult skill \u2013 there are so many variables and that\u2019s before you add in the opposition chasing you down and the sense of urgency that comes with knowing the game could end at any moment. I remember mine against Stade Fran\u00e7ais in the Heineken Cup in 2008 \u2013 it was probably the ugliest drop-goal I\u2019ve ever kicked but it doesn\u2019t matter if it goes over. But what we saw with Sexton was a world-class piece of skill from a world-class player.", "title": "The beauty of Ford-Farrell is you have another 10 to see the space | Nick Evans"}
