Tenacity pours out of her beneath the curved white tube of ice that comprises the bobsleigh track at K\u00f6nigssee \u2013 where McNeill will drive a sled down a dizzying slope at 80mph. The Winter Olympics begin in Pyeongchang on Friday and she needs to steel herself during practice. A few weeks ago, McNeill and Mica Moore, her brakewoman, endured a terrifying crash at Altenburg that flipped their sled over and dragged them, upside down, along the ice. It was the latest ordeal in a five-month period when McNeill\u2019s funding was ended by her own federation amid allegations of mismanagement while three men\u2019s crews continued to be financed. Her defiant response was thrilling \u2013 and means she can participate as planned in her first Olympics. McNeill appears fearless at K\u00f6nigssee and lost in a solitary dance before racing \u2013 moving from side to side as her hands trace the imagined trajectory of her speeding sled. She sees every blurring turn in her head prior to one of her last runs before Pyeongchang. She and Montell Douglas, her reserve brakewoman, are at the top of the slope. They push the heavy sled hard before jumping into the hurtling missile. It is only later that McNeill talks about fear and danger. \u201cAnyone watching from the outside says we\u2019re crazy,\u201d says the 24-year-old from Consett, County Durham. \u201cBut when you do go down you learn to love it and, even if you are a bit scared, you can push through it. If I was in the back I\u2019d be a nervous wreck but as the driver I feel in control. I know that nine times out of 10 we\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d McNeill, Moore and Douglas lift the sled into the back of their van. They tell me cheerfully the van is called Sid and their sled is known as Roman. \u201cWe love singing in Sid,\u201d McNeill says. \u201cSometimes a road trip can be over 10 hours and we have to entertain ourselves. In North America we actually videoed ourselves doing a carpool karaoke. It\u2019s a great laugh and something you have to do to get through a 10-hour drive down the autobahn in the dark.\u201d At least it is a short drive from the track to the small chalet they have found themselves, without British Bobsleigh\u2019s assistance, in Berchtesgaden. Following Sid on a snowy evening it is easy to forget that Hitler and his inner circle used Berchtesgaden as a Nazi retreat. Bavaria is different now and McNeill\u2019s story is compelling. \u201cIt was a devastation,\u201d she says, remembering the moment last September when she heard her team\u2019s funding had been obliterated less than five months before the Olympics. We sit in the garage next to Sid and Roman while her team-mates prepare dinner inside. It is freezing but determination burns inside McNeill\u2019s composed account of a sporting scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s like imagining having a dream or a goal and sacrificing your family, your friends, holidays, Christmas Day. You\u2019re sacrificing all this in the gym, on the sprint track, giving everything for so long \u2013 and then someone else has made a mistake that leaves nothing. It\u2019s hard to explain the devastation. Part of me couldn\u2019t believe it but at the same time, with that system, it didn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d You\u2019re sacrificing everything then someone makes a mistake that leaves nothing. It\u2019s hard to explain the devastation McNeill says she had questioned the BBSA (British Bobsleigh & Skeleton Association) for weeks. She knew they had received \u00a35m of lottery funding to cover the four-year cycle to Pyeongchang but she sensed trouble. She says she kept asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d without receiving an answer. \u201cThen they got all the women into one room and said: \u2018There isn\u2019t any money.\u2019 We said: \u2018What do you mean? Not even one penny? Where\u2019s it gone?\u2019 To not have an answer was heartbreaking.\u201d McNeill\u2019s own sled had already been bought by her father for \u00a350,000. Her anguish was deepened because there was still enough money to fund three men\u2019s teams for the qualification season for the 2018 Olympics. McNeill and Moore had won gold at the Junior Bobsleigh World Championships early in 2017 but they were not considered by the BBSA to match the potential of the men. The organisation said it was \u201cfocusing resources on winning medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics\u201d. Just over a week later, after her crowdfunding success, the governing body freed up money to partially fund McNeill. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking in a modern age where gender should be equal,\u201d McNeill says. \u201cWhen I asked for the data for their decision there weren\u2019t many answers \u2013 which led to more frustration. I was gobsmacked and so angry. By the time I spoke to my family I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not going to accept it. It\u2019s two weeks until the winter season in Olympic year. Let\u2019s reach out to the public.\u2019 \u201cIt was a last resort. There\u2019s no way I would have asked for help if I didn\u2019t think me and the team, us women, deserved to go to the Olympics. I made the crowdfunding page and I knew it might not work out. It might raise only \u00a310. But the response was incredible.\u201d On a bleak night in Berchtesgaden, McNeill\u2019s face lights up as she remembers how people responded to her plea to raise \u00a330,000 to cover her team\u2019s basic running costs. \u201cI was really worried about telling the story. What happens if people think we\u2019re greedy? It was a risk and I was very nervous but we set it up. I remember I\u2019d just finished training and I was about to eat my packed lunch. One of the boys nudged me and went: \u2018Look.\u2019 I looked up at the screen and I was on the news. I was like: \u2018Oh my gosh!\u2019 It had started \u2013 and it went absolutely wild.\u201d McNeill smiles helplessly. \u201cI sat reading the comments and I was overwhelmed. I remember the money was ticking up and up and then someone put \u00a35,000 in and I thought: \u2018Maybe we can do it because we\u2019re almost a third there on day one.\u2019 We hit the target by day five or six and I was in tears. I went shopping with my mum and we were walking through the mall and I just cried.\u201d Her sled now boasts a Powered by the People logo \u2013 which will be removed in Pyeongchang because the IOC will not allow any \u201cpolitical\u201d slogans. But McNeill and her team \u201care so grateful because the majority of the funding are small donations \u2013 \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 which is mad, isn\u2019t it? Over 700 people just coming together and helping us. Over \u00a340,000 has been raised which is absolutely incredible.\u201d By contrast the atmosphere at British Bobsleigh before the funding cuts \u201cwas very toxic. The management made it very difficult and the athletes struggled to perform.\u201d McNeill says there has been a much more positive mood since several members of staff decided to leave, though there is no suggestion of wrongdoing. \u201cWe\u2019re so lucky now that everything has changed and we have new management.\u201d There was further strife when it emerged that the current head coach, Lee Johnston, allegedly said in 2013 that \u201cblack drivers do not make good bobsleigh drivers\u201d. McNeill supports Johnston: \u201cLee raised me through development. If you speak to the athletes, it was something that was blown out of proportion.\u201d The public have been the heroes The BBSA restructured their organisation and found some money to give to McNeill\u2019s team, who are now ranked 12th in the world. The two men\u2019s GB teams to feature in Pyeongchang are ranked 11th and 12th. \u201cObviously they support us on the coaching and medical side, so they\u2019re chipping in,\u201d McNeill says diplomatically, but in terms of hard cash they have contributed only a small amount. She underlines that \u201cthe public have been the heroes\u201d. There is something heroic about McNeill and her team-mates. \u201cAltenburg was a shock,\u201d she says, recalling her recent crash. \u201cIn the first heat we flew down; we were in a great position. In the second heat we were picking up speed and going into corner 13 we were slightly late. Our bale [front wing] caught the wall which lifted the sled up and caused us to roll into the corner, which is one of the roughest crashes you can have. For me, that was the worst crash. \u201cWe were going close to 80mph. I was hurting. I had bruises on my leg, my ribs, my scapula; it was all bruised and battered. We needed new helmets. But the sled was all right and most importantly Mica and myself walked away and came back the next week and raced \u2013 which was incredible. It went great in St Moritz. We were thrilled with seventh.\u201d They would love to make the top six, or even higher, in the Olympics. \u201cThat\u2019s the aim. There\u2019s always a chance of getting a medal, particularly in an ice sport.\u201d McNeill will be powered by her people \u2013 and the wider message of her successful campaign. \u201cHopefully it tells people if you want something you need to go out there and get it. In the next Olympic cycle I want to start dominating the world and looking to definitely get that gold medal in Beijing [in 2022].\u201d Does she expect to again be powered by the people? McNeill smiles in the stark and icy garage. \u201cHopefully not. Hopefully everything will fall into place and the people can just watch. They won\u2019t have to dig their hands in their pockets.\u201d", "title": "Bobsledder Mica McNeill: \u2018We hit the crowdfunding target and I was in tears\u2019"}
