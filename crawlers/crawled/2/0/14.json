The Netherlands international has made an eventful start to his Liverpool career: scoring a late FA Cup winner against Everton on his debut, conceding a 95th-minute penalty against Spurs on Sunday and being told to lose weight by an Anfield predecessor in Jamie Carragher. \u201cHe needs to come into the dressing room and see if I need to lose some weight because I don\u2019t think I need to,\u201d Van Dijk responded, jokingly, to Carragher\u2019s comment. Van Dijk accepts he is under the spotlight after Liverpool broke their transfer record and the world record for a defender last month to sign him from Southampton, who J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team face on Sunday. The 26-year-old insists he can cope with the pressure, although he believes Liverpool\u2019s overall defending should not be judged purely on the basis of his transfer fee. \u201cI know because I made such a big step, for a lot of money, everything is going to be analysed,\u201d the Liverpool centre-half said. \u201cNo one is going to look at the good things you do. Everybody is going to watch the bad things and that is how it is. But I will discuss it with the people who want to make me better, who can make me better, and that is the manager and the players around me. If they think it is right then that is the way forward. \u201cIt is a strength of mine to not really bother too much when people have their opinions, especially negative opinions. I know when I am doing it well and exactly when I am doing it wrong. No one will talk about my performance [against Spurs] in general. We defended very well, had two penalties against us with a lot of question marks around them, but no one is going to talk about that. But I know that as a team we did very well against one of the best strikers in Europe [Harry Kane].\u201d Klopp has claimed it will be next season before Liverpool see the best of Van Dijk given he missed much of last year with an ankle injury. The Liverpool manager, who also kept the defender on the bench for last week\u2019s win at Huddersfield, also believes the Dutchman will need time to adapt to a different playing style. Van Dijk concurred: \u201cI have been out for eight months \u2013 last January until September really \u2013 and I didn\u2019t play at Premier League level. It is not easy to come back and especially when I have made such a big step as now with all the eyes on me and they look at every small detail. I am just focusing on the team and myself. \u201cThe football we play, the pressing, the different options with players, it is totally different. So you need time to get used to everything but I am working on it every day together with the team. I am talking with the manager and everyone who can help me out.\u201d The defender also insisted he has no concern over the reception that potentially awaits him at St Mary\u2019s this weekend. \u201cMaybe they can boo the whole game. What can you do about it? You can\u2019t do anything. I made the decision, I have enjoyed every bit of it and I am very grateful for everything that they [Southampton] did for me. I have moved on, they have moved on.\u201d", "title": "Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk: I can handle the pressure of \u00a375m price tag"}
