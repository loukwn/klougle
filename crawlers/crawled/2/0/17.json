As we settle into the common room at the top of the youth scholars\u2019 boarding house at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s training ground, on Big Brother-style soft furnishings between table football and a games console, the club\u2019s press officer points out this sort of dedicated facility did not exist when the midfielder was a teenage aspirant. Sahin, from the age of 12, and the other scholars lived in a boarding house in the city centre. It was there he met and lived with Marcel Schmelzer, the club\u2019s long\u2011serving left-back, \u201cone of the best friends I ever had or ever will have.\u201d For the first six months they did not get on. \u201cI was already a professional and everybody\u2019s darling,\u201d says Sahin, smiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to school that much and he had to bring my homework home. The teachers asked him where I was and he always had to lie for me. He\u2019d tell them I was at football when I was actually in bed resting for training.\u201d Last May Schmelzer caused a stir after Dortmund\u2019s DfB Pokal final win over Eintracht Frankfurt, publicly rebuking the team\u2019s then coach for leaving Sahin out. \u201cI never had a problem with Thomas Tuchel,\u201d Sahin underlines, making clear he did not agitate for the departure of a man who ruffled feathers throughout the club in his two years at the helm. The removal of Tuchel was just the tip of the iceberg in a turbulent 2017 for Dortmund, which incorporated the shocking attack on the team bus in April \u2013 which he understandably feels he is done with talking about \u2013 and ended with Peter Bosz\u2019s short and ill-fated spell in charge. The Dutchman\u2019s tenure had its silver lining for Sahin on a personal level \u2013 their paths had crossed when Bosz was the Feyenoord technical director and Sahin was on loan there as a teenager, and the Turkey midfielder was successfully restored to the BVB lineup \u2013 though he emphasises the end of a miserable spell of injuries has been key. \u201cIn the last eight months,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m the boss of my own body again.\u201d Despite this Sahin\u2019s frustration that the club are not quite hitting the heights of his first spell, or indeed the run to the Champions League final in 2013, shortly after he returned from Real Madrid, is palpable. Things did not work out for Sahin in Spain: after one season on the bench under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho he left to join Liverpool for a season on loan, which lasted only five months before he was back at Dortmund in January 2013. \u201cThe club grew up too much in the last 10 years to accept anything else,\u201d he says, speaking with the insistence of a fan \u2013 because that is what he is. \u201cThere was no other choice,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always Dortmund.\u201d It was a commitment cemented when he impressed the club on trial as a seven-year-old, in the midst of Ottmar Hitzfeld\u2019s glory era. On the night of the Champions League final in 1997 Sahin\u2019s parents went out for his mother\u2019s birthday dinner. Nuri and his brother Ufuk stayed at home and watched the game, transfixed. Sixteen years later, the newly returned Sahin was on the bench at Wembley as BVB faced Bayern Munich. \u201cI was sure we were going to win,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only problem was that Bayern already lost two finals [recently] so, if there\u2019s a football god, he was with Bayern.\u201d When the final whistle went, it all started to flood back. \u201cI started to cry,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t cry that much because of football but the movie of \u201997 \u2013 me in the living room, with my brother, with our own Champions League trophy that we were holding in our hands \u2013 went through my mind. When we went up, I wondered if I should touch it but I thought no. Maybe God will give me another chance one day.\u201d The Europa League, with a tie against Atalanta on the horizon, remains a target under Peter St\u00f6ger but the aspirations from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s era remain with Sahin. \u201cHe gave us the philosophy that we can beat anyone,\u201d Sahin says. \u201cI remember when we played at Bayern Munich [in February 2011] in the season we became champions. We were seven points in front of them and we were in the hotel saying: \u2018OK, when we get a draw here, there are only a few more games to go.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how but he heard from someone that we were talking [like] this. He\u2019s very smart, as you know \u2026 and then we had the most amazing meeting before the game. By the time we got on the bus I knew we\u2019d win the game [Dortmund won 3-1].\u201d The pair remain close \u2013 as Klopp promised they would when he accepted Sahin\u2019s decision to go to the Bernab\u00e9u after the 2011 Bundesliga win \u2013 and discuss a range of subjects beyond football, including Brexit. \u201cI spoke with J\u00fcrgen about it,\u201d he confides. \u201cOn the night [of the referendum] we were having dinner at his house in Dortmund. We spoke about how it will influence football, and transfers, and what it\u2019ll do to the pound and the euro. I don\u2019t know everything but I want to learn and to speak to experts to know more.\u201d That desire to see life in widescreen extends to thinking post-career, with Sahin booked on a sports management course at Harvard this summer. \u201cI have big plans after football, to give back and to give my children something to be proud of. Not just to talk about how I used to be a football player.\u201d For now, at 29, he has plenty of that left, and recognises his role in guiding the club\u2019s younger talent, though he has no desire to lecture them. The burgeoning quality at the club excites him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy a ticket to watch a player like me. I\u00a0would always buy a ticket to watch Jadon Sancho beating two players.\u201d Whatever is next, Dortmund will remain his constant. \u201cIt\u2019s a story I hope will never end, even after my career has finished,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s as a player, coach, board member or even as a fan, I want to bring the Champions League back to this place. I just want to see what will happen on the streets because I saw it when we won the German Cup, and the Bundesliga, and it was crazy. It would be the last chapter I\u2019m missing to write a book.\u201d", "title": "Nuri Sahin: \u2018I want to give back after football and my children to be proud\u2019"}
