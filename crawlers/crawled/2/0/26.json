A precautionary inspection at 8am found that the track was raceable, but conditions continued to deteriorate and the decision to abandon was finally taken at 11am. Punters should perhaps already be given a red warning over Tuesdays at Southwell. On last Tuesday\u2019s card, only one favourite obliged there \u2013 with winners in other races including a 16-1 shot, a 14-1 and a 10-1. The previous two Tuesdays saw more than a few double-figure winners, including two at 25-1.  Odds On Oli (2.00) was a warm favourite in a mile race at Wolverhampton 18 days ago, but was beaten a neck by the 22-1 outsider Plansina. This pair of three-year-olds take each other on over the same trip today and are again drawn in close proximity \u2013 but at a different track. Odds On Oli is 1lb better off at the weights this time and makes his Southwell debut.  Richard Fahey was by no means predicting victory, but Odds On Oli\u2019s trainer did hold out hope, saying on Monday evening: \u201cThe pace may suit our horse better tomorrow. They go quicker around Southwell.\u201d  Jack Blane (4.10) rates the nap. This four-year-old won twice at Wolverhampton last year, but has been placed twice from two runs since being switched to Southwell for the first time this year. Dawn Dancer (1.30) looks the one to side with in the opening contest. Oisi\u00adn Murphy\u2019s mount has experience of this course and can make that count against main market rival Pacific Fleet.
