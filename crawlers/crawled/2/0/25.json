Just because they carried the Vince Lombardi trophy through a blizzard of confetti in Minneapolis doesn\u2019t mean they are required to drag it into the Rose Garden and hold it aloft for Donald Trump. The presidential celebration for a major American sports champion is a tradition replayed for nearly four decades. It is not a requirement. It is not a mandate. The Golden State Warriors set a precedent after winning the NBA championship last year when they\u00a0expressed so little interest in continuing the practice that Trump refused to invite them.\u00a0Instead, the Warriors plan to use the days surrounding their 28 February game at the Washington Wizards to\u00a0\u201ccelebrate equality, diversity and inclusion.\u201d Somehow it makes sense the Warriors would protest Trump: the NBA has been open in encouraging their players in a league that is around 75% black to speak against racial inequality. Few in the NBA blinked when their champion did not want to visit a president who has helped legitimize white supremacist movements. But the NFL, which is around 65% black, has never been comfortable with teams and players taking social stands \u2013 as evidenced by the fact that Colin Kaepernick, whose refusal to stand for the national anthem has been his own protest for racial equality, remains unsigned.\u00a0 An entire NFL team declining a White House visit would be a significant rebuke of Trump and his policies, one unimaginable before Kaepernick began his protest two years ago.\u00a0 Already three Eagles players \u2013 safety Malcolm Jenkins, defensive end Chris Long and receiver Torrey Smith \u2013 have said\u00a0they won\u2019t attend a White House celebration.\u00a0That the three would refuse to meet Trump is hardly a surprise, they make up three-quarters of a group that\u00a0openly supported Kaepernick last season\u00a0and forced the NFL to contribute\u00a0close to $100m to social causes.\u00a0Long skipped the White House trip last year after winning the Super Bowl with the New England Patriots as did his current Eagles team-mate LaGarrette Blount, who said at the time:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t feel welcome in that house, I\u2019m just gonna leave it at that.\u201d At what point does an Eagles boycott become so large that it\u2019s not worth the team going to the White House? Is it five players? Ten? Twenty? There is a number and reaching it would be an enormous statement by a franchise in a league that hates such controversies.\u00a0 Football has always had a kinship with the American military. Key pieces of the game\u2019s terminology\u00a0are war metaphors\u00a0including phrases like \u201cbomb\u201d, \u201cfield general\u201d and \u201cblitz\u201d. Players often speak of \u201cgoing to war,\u201d when they take the field. And the NFL has always pushed itself as the patriotic league with giant flags brought out for the national anthem followed by flyovers by fighter jets \u2013 even when the stadium has a roof and the planes are not visible to players and fans.\u00a0 Even with several Eagles players saying they will skip the White House, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the whole team refusing to show. Until Kaepernick, NFL players rarely seemed political and there are far more Trump supporters in NFL locker rooms than in the NBA. Football team owners, front office executives and coaches tend to be conservative and their discomfort with Kaepernick\u2019s actions make a statement as extreme as a team boycott of Trump unlikely.\u00a0 League leaders have spent weeks trying to mend the damage they believe they absorbed\u00a0in September\u00a0when Trump said any player who protested was a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d. The NFL wrapped Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in patriotism like they have so many others and must have been thrilled when players on both teams stood for the anthem. Just as commissioner Roger Goodell tried to pacify both angry players and owners irate with the protests, Goodell likely would search for a public relations solution to a potential Eagles White House boycott.\u00a0 Though White House visits have been non-political in the years before Trump came to power the tradition has been a positive photo opportunity for presidents. The first Super Bowl winner to visit the White House, the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1980, visited Jimmy Carter along with baseball\u2019s Pittsburgh Pirates, who had won the World Series a few months before.\u00a0 Their trip came at the end of February 1980, a precarious time for Carter who was embroiled in the Iran Hostage crisis and was facing a robust Democratic primary challenge from Ted Kennedy. The Steelers visit gave Carter a positive news day in a state with a key primary just weeks away. Carter\u00a0filled his remarks that day\u00a0with references to \u201cWestern Pennsylvania\u201d as if pleading for votes. His successor, Ronald Reagan, always a master of optics, must have seen the value in celebrating a winning team and kept rolling Super Bowl champions through the White House as did every president since. Trump\u2019s divisiveness brings a different challenge, one the Philadelphia Eagles \u2013\u00a0who are perhaps the NFL\u2019s most socially conscious team\u00a0\u2013 must weigh. Visiting is always a political statement even if it doesn\u2019t appear to be one.\u00a0 Already three have said they will break an old tradition. Will their team-mates follow?", "title": "Three Eagles will shun a White House visit. Will their team-mates follow?"}
