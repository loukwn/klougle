I\u2019ve put in a new tumble since Rio. I\u2019ve put in a new travel on pommel since last year. So I\u2019m making these upgrades, and it\u2019s funny because when you say two new skills, it doesn\u2019t sound like a lot. But it\u2019s so hard to do.\u201d Whitlock\u2019s words could be read as an act of retrospective justification. Team GB\u2019s poster boy of the 2016 Olympics, with his two individual golds, his charming smile and his pommeling around on the plane home, has had a tricky 2018. Whitlock struggled at the Commonwealth Games in the spring while, this summer, his European Championships ended in misfortune as he stopped cold on the apparatus during the pommel horse final and was forced into a dismount. So it could be an instance of Whitlock getting his excuses in late. But sitting with this engaging and well-meaning young man, it does not feel like that. He has always been someone who has one eye on what is coming next. As for his routines, the 25-year-old warned about the complexity he was adding to them ahead of this year\u2019s competitions. \u201cIt\u2019s important to take things from competitions that didn\u2019t go to plan but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always done,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when I was young and I made a massive mistake I still used to think there was a chance I could make the final. I\u2019ve always had that mindset. The Commonwealth Games didn\u2019t go to plan, the Europeans didn\u2019t go to plan. It\u2019s part of the process, it really is. If there\u2019s a competition that I\u2019ve gone to and made mistakes, like those two, I\u2019ve learned so much. Looking at the big picture, you\u2019re not going to have every competition go perfectly \u2013 you\u2019re just not.\u201d Later this week, Whitlock will begin competition at the World Artistic Gymnastic Championships in Doha. It\u2019s another marker for the progress of his new routines, designed with the aim of being just right come 2020 and the Olympics. But, it is also a crucial event for the team with a medal finish in the group competition meaning immediate qualification for Tokyo. According to Whitlock, coming in the top three would be \u201ca huge, huge thing for our mindsets, for everything going forward. We\u2019ll have that spot then and it\u2019s about working towards the bigger picture as well.\u201d His eye for both the immediate and the longer term does not stop with his sporting life. With his wife, Leah, an elite gymnastics coach, they have begun to roll out Max Whitlock Gymnastics, a programme for children aged four to 11 that they hope will cater to a demand for the sport. The plan is to have it up and running in 32 different leisure centres by the end of the year. Neither is that the only project the couple have under way; they are expecting their first child in February. \u201cThe painting, the decorating, everything to be honest, I\u2019m planning on doing it when I get back from the worlds,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to work hard on it then, because it\u2019s going to come around quickly. \u201cFor me and Leah it\u2019s been a bit of a surreal thing. So many people have had kids before but you feel like you\u2019re in your own world when it happens to you. You can\u2019t wait for it but you\u2019re also worrying because you want everything to go OK. What I\u2019ve been doing is to make sure that Leah\u2019s OK, eating good, drinking enough. Making sure she\u2019s getting a lot of fruit and veg, stuff like that. But I think it is a bit different for the guy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Successful Olympians are always expected to be role models, and Whitlock certainly fits the bill. Young, clean-cut and handsome, he has a lifestyle that many would aspire to. His Instagram feed is full of pictures of him living the good life, with the odd sponsored post by a protein shake partner and a not inconsiderable number of top-off shots. Whitlock says he gets a lot of comments about his well-honed physique (he gets a lot of likes too). He also isn\u2019t too keen to draw conclusions from that, particularly about what young men think about their own bodies. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to say it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing to make people body conscious because everyone should feel comfortable in their own bodies, but social media does create that when people put out stuff that\u2019s not \u2026 real.\u201d What he does know, though, is that he has helped to make gymnastics a sport that boys and young men want to be a part of. \u201cWe wanted to do that, to try and make it a bit of a cooler sport to be part of,\u201d he says. \u201cI think fitness as an industry has blown up huge and you can look at gymnasts and they\u2019re extremely fit. I think gymnastics can help with movement, agility, stuff like that. Girls are still loving gymnastics and I think they always will, but boys\u2019 participation in gymnastics is rising a lot and it\u2019s important to keep pushing that too.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/24/max-whitlock-make-gymastics-cooler-interview-world-championships"}
