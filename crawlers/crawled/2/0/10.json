The referees\u2019 group took the unusual step of explaining the process behind Harry Kane\u2019s missed penalty at Anfield on Sunday after Moss and his assistant, Edward Smart, were recorded debating the legitimacy of the 85th-minute spot-kick. Kane was in an offside position when collecting Dele Alli\u2019s pass but the Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren sliced the ball into the striker\u2019s path before he was brought down by Loris Karius. Moss was heard on a pitch-side microphone saying: \u201cI have no idea whether Lovren touched the ball to be honest with you. Martin, have you got anything from TV?\u201d He then added: \u201cI\u2019m giving the penalty.\u201d The TV question was to Martin Atkinson but, with VAR not in use in the Premier League, Moss has accepted he was wrong to request outside help via the fourth official. In a statement, however, PGMOL insists the referee ultimately made the right decision. It read: \u201cJon Moss was in a good position to see that a Liverpool player deliberately played the ball before it fell to Harry Kane in the penalty area. He then correctly judged that Kane was fouled by Lorius [sic] Karius. However, given the speed of the attack he was uncertain of the identity of the Liverpool player who kicked the ball. Eddie Smart, having identified that Kane was in an offside position, correctly sought clarification on whether Dejan Lovren had deliberately played the ball. His question created some momentary confusion when Eddie asked if \u201cLovren\u201d had touched the ball. Moss knew a Liverpool player had touched the ball but not that it was Lovren. \u201cHe then asked a question to his fourth official Martin Atkinson and acknowledges referencing \u2018TV\u2019 was misguided. Atkinson did not reply to the question and so had no involvement in the decision. Having properly reflected on the questions asked, Jon knew a Liverpool player, now identified as Lovren, had played the ball and that no offside offence had occurred. He then awarded the penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, Atkinson did not view a television monitor and did not\u00a0relay any information to the on\u2011field officials. \u201cIn real time this was a difficult series of decisions which the match officials judged correctly in recognising that Kane was not offside, as Lovren had deliberately played the ball, and he was fouled for the award of the penalty kick. The interpretation of \u201cdeliberately\u201d kicking a ball considers whether a player has intentionally tried to kick a ball \u2013 it does not consider whether the ball ends up where a player may have wanted to kick it.\u201d", "title": "Referee Jon Moss \u2018misguided\u2019 to ask for TV help in Liverpool game"}
