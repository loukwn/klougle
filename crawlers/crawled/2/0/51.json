The Manchester City manager received a frantic phone call from his wife, Cristina, who, along with their daughters, Valentina and Maria, was at the Ariana Grande concert that was targeted by a suicide bomber in May 2017. Guardiola told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cI was at home with my son and my wife and daughters were there. At the end we were lucky. Unfortunately [there were many] people who suffered. \u201cShe called me but immediately the line broke. She told me: \u2018Something happened and we are running but I don\u2019t know what happened,\u2019 and the line broke. We tried to call her again and it didn\u2019t work. We went to the arena. After five or six minutes she called me again and said:\u2018We are out, we are out.\u2019\u201d Twenty-two people were killed in the attack and hundreds injured. Guardiola, who was coming towards the end of his first year in Manchester, felt the city\u2019s response to the tragedy showed the best of humanity. He believes more of that attitude would help the world deal with other problems, such as the refugee crisis. \u201cWhen this kind of thing happens it shows the best of us,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cSometimes these kind of things happen. The times we are living right now, all around the world many things have happened. People are dying. \u201cOf course it is not about everyone coming here but they have to try to do it. People are dying, it needs open arms to go in there and try to help them.\u201d Guardiola, who led City to the Premier League title last season, has developed a close bond with the city. \u201cI will be Mancunian for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be a Manchester City fan and it will be impossible to train another team in England like Manchester City because I feel beloved from the people here. \u201cI like to do it better, to seduce them, to make a better club so they can believe we are strong enough to do better things, but all human beings want to be supported in the bad moments. That is why it is perfect.\u201d Guardiola was speaking in a wide-ranging interview in which he also discussed his respect for Johan Cruyff and his sabbatical in New York, where he met Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012. The 47-year-old said: \u201cI met him more as a person, it was fantastic. It is a joy to meet extraordinary people.\u201d Ferguson had emergency brain surgery earlier this year but is recovering well and has been back to Old Trafford. \u201cWhen I saw him with the crowd clapping \u2013 how they loved him,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad he\u2019s coming back and going well.\u201d  ", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/25/pep-guardiola-manchester-arena-family-terror-attack"}
