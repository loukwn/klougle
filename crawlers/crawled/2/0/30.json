Butler, who had played in 98% of the Patriots\u2019 defensive snaps leading up to Sunday\u2019s loss to the Eagles was bemused when he was all but excluded from the action in Minneapolis, only making a brief appearance for special teams duty. Butler was seen in tears before the game and was at a loss to explain why he was omitted afterwards, with back-up Eric Rowe unexpectedly taking his place. \u201cThey gave up on me,\u201d Butler told ESPN. \u201cFuck. It is what it is. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was. I guess I wasn\u2019t playing good or they didn\u2019t feel comfortable. I don\u2019t know. But I could have changed that game.\u201d Coach Bill Belichick\u2019s decision, in a game in which the Patriots struggled to stop the Eagles offense, was called into question by many observers, including former New England cornerback Brandon Browner. He said Belichick was guilty of a \u201cpower trip\u201d. My understanding is the benching of #Patriots CB Malcolm Butler happened because of a perfect storm of issues: Sickness, a rough week of practice, and a minor rule violation believed to be related to curfew. A complicated matter. pic.twitter.com/TmUJgkHpsZ On Monday night, Rapoport said Butler had been excluded for a number of reasons. \u201cOne thing that Bill Belichick said this morning was that a lot goes into it,\u201d Rapoport said on NFL Network\u2019s Total Access. \u201cAnd yes, from what I understand, there are several factors that led Malcolm Butler, one of the team\u2019s top defensive players, to not be out on the field for the Super Bowl. Among those, he showed up a day later than team-mates because he was sick. Remember, he was not at Opening Night. That was a factor. I\u2019m also told that during practice this week he really struggled. Had a rough week of practice, perhaps because of illness, but maybe because of other things. That was one thing they had to consider in putting Eric Rowe out there instead of him. \u201cBut I\u2019m also told there were some other issues, disciplinary issues. There was a small or minor violation of team rules that happened earlier in the week that is one thing. And then there are some attitudes, frustrations as well. All of this combined to put Malcolm Butler not on the field with his team-mates trying to win the Super Bowl, but on the sideline watching.\u201d The famously taciturn Belichick would not expand on why he had omitted Butler. \u201cI respect Malcolm\u2019s competitiveness, and I\u2019m sure that he felt like he could have helped,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m sure other players felt the same way. In the end, we have to make the decisions that we feel are best for the football team, and that\u2019s what we did, that\u2019s what I did.\u201d Butler had a disappointing regular season and is expected to leave the Patriots in the coming months.", "title": "Report: Malcolm Butler's shock Super Bowl omission down to 'perfect storm'"}
