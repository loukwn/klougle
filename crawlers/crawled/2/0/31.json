The 26-year-old Jackson was killed on Sunday in a car accident and police have detained a suspected drunk driver in connection with the death. Police say Manuel Orrego-Savala, who is originally from Guatemala, was in the US illegally at the time of Jackson\u2019s death and had been deported from America twice in the past. So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! \u201cSo disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson,\u201d wrote the president on Twitter on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!\u201d The president later added his condolences to Jackson\u2019s family: \u201cMy prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken.\u201d According to police, Orrego-Savala\u2019s blood alcohol levels were three times the legal limit when he drove on to the shoulder of Interstate 70 in Indianapolis and hit Jackson. Jackson had pulled over after he felt sick and was being helped by another driver, 54-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, who was also struck and killed.  \u201cWe were heartbroken to hear the news of Edwin Jackson\u2019s passing,\u201d the Colts said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cEdwin was loved by all in the Colts organization. We admired his outgoing personality, competitive spirit and hard-working mentality. He was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths, and he will be greatly missed in our locker room and throughout our entire organization. \u201cWe also understand that another person lost his life in the accident, only adding to our sorrow on this day. We are shocked and saddened by this tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of both men during this difficult time.\u201d", "title": "Donald Trump uses death of Colts' Edwin Jackson to attack illegal immigrants"}
