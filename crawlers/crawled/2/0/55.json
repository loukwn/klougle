The Switzerland international was fined 10,000 Swiss francs by Fifa for \u201cunsporting behaviour\u201d after scoring a 90th-minute winner against Serbia in June. Shaqiri and the Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka celebrated by putting their hands together to form a double-headed eagle, as represented on the flag of Albania, who fought against Serbia in the Kosovo War. Shaqiri was born in the Kosovan city of Gjilan and sported the flag of Kosovo on his boots in the Group E match, prompting a complaint from the Football Association of Serbia. Liverpool\u2019s summer signing will travel to Serbia in a fortnight when J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team play Red Star Belgrade in their Champions League return fixture. Red Star\u2019s sporting director, Zvezdan Terzic, has claimed the 27-year-old may avoid the trip because of the guaranteed hostility. \u201cIf he comes he\u2019ll be smaller than a poppy seed,\u201d said Terzic, who added that the Serbian champions had a \u201cduty to protect\u201d Shaqiri. The former Stoke City forward, however, insists he has no reservations about playing at the Rajko Mitic Stadium on 6 November. \u201cI had this already at the World Cup so I know I can handle this no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cNo concerns. I saw a few articles where one player said something. I don\u2019t really care what people are saying. I just go there to play a football game. It is not about politics it is about football. I worry about nothing and go to play.\u201d Shaqiri was instrumental in Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Red Star at Anfield on Wednesday with a key role in both first-half goals for Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah. Klopp described the Swiss international\u2019s flick to Salah as \u201cgenius link-up play\u201d, prompting a satisfied response from the man in question. \u201cI just want to say \u2018thank you\u2019 for that,\u201d said Shaqiri when told of his manager\u2019s praise. \u201cIt is a game where I am trying my best to give him good performances. I need to try to keep going. I think I have the quality and vision to give good passes and you can see that I wanted to give another good performance. I am enjoying the football here and you can see that on the pitch. The most important thing is to win as a team and the game was brilliant from everyone.\u201d Shaqiri has impressed since his arrival from Stoke but has had to adapt from being a regular starter at his former club to a valuable squad player in varying roles at Liverpool so far. \u201cSometimes it is not simple because the manager changes a few things but you have to do your best. You can see on the pitch we have a lot of good players and creativity and together we can line-up very well. I am proud to have started in the Champions League.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/25/xherdan-shaqiri-liverpool-serbia-switzerland-world-cup"}
