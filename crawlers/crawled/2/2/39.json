Feras Fayyad spent a year following a handful of volunteer rescue workers in the besieged Syrian city as they rushed towards bombed buildings to try and find people in the rubble. The resulting documentary has earned widespread critical praise and won awards including the Sundance grand jury prize. However, the international recognition has been accompanied by an organized attempt to tarnish the film-maker\u2019s reputation, following a playbook of Russia-backed disinformation and manipulation.  \u201cIt is like Russia wants to hack the Oscars like they hacked the US election,\u201d he told the Guardian. Since the Oscar nominations were announced, Fayyad, a Syrian national, has become the subject of several articles by Russia state news agency Sputnik News and \u201calternative news\u201d sites to discredit his work, describing it as a \u201cpropaganda piece funded by western governments\u201d and an \u201cAl-Qaida promotional film\u201d. Others have trawled through his social media accounts and published pictures of his family and friends. Syrian state media has followed suit. On Twitter and Facebook, dozens of accounts have accused Fayyad of being a liar and terrorist sympathiser. Other Oscar-nominated film-makers and Academy members say the campaign could affect Fayyad\u2019s chances of winning the award. Chris Hegedus, who made Oscar-nominated documentary The War Room, described the articles as \u201coutrageous\u201d and said that they \u201cmade us see how Russia and others are meddling beyond social media and political elections\u201d.  \u201cIt can definitely influence voters and make them question the legitimacy of a film to have false reports circulating and rumours that a film\u2019s integrity is questioned,\u201d she said.  Producer Amy Ziering agreed, mentioning other \u201cwhite noise disinformation campaigns\u201d including one that targeted her campus rape documentary The Hunting Ground and another that took aim at An Inconvenient Truth. \u201cIt can very much damage an Oscar campaign\u2019s success, but even more importantly it can damage the ability for important and necessary truths to be told,\u201d she said. Fayyad is baffled by the attacks on his reputation, particularly as he feels that the theme of his documentary is not the White Helmets as an organisation but an intimate look at the lives of a handful of people struggling to get by in a civil war.  \u201cThe film is coming from the side of the human being. It\u2019s about a Syrian who is torn between his responsibility to his community and to his family,\u201d he said, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where his film was screened. It\u2019s a dilemma that Fayyad has experienced in his quest to make documentaries about people in Syria. In pursuing his work on the ground he attracted the attention of Syria\u2019s intelligence service, and spent many months being tortured in prison on suspicion of being a spy. After being arrested at the airport and bundled into a vehicle with his T-shirt pulled over his head as a makeshift hood, Fayyad recalls peeping down from his blindfold at the knock-off Adidas shoes of one of his torturers. For months he passed between beatings, starvation and periods in isolation, stepping over dead bodies left in corridors and bathrooms. The Syrian regime insisted he was a spy working for the US or Europe. Those months behind bars flash into Fayyad\u2019s mind when faced with the unfounded criticism of his work. To be accused of being a spy or propagandist is a terrifying prospect.  \u201cIn the community in the Middle East this is shameful and it would make people not trust me if they think I\u2019m collecting information for the FBI,\u201d he said.  He is daunted by the prospect of winning, believing it could exacerbate the harassment. \u201cI feel scared about what we might go through,\u201d he said.", "title": "'Russia wants to hack the Oscars': smear campaign targets Syrian nominee"}
