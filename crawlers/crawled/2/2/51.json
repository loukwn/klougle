Born in Manchester, he moved to the US as a young man, becoming an English teacher, then an editor of a medical journal. He became an actor in his late 30s. Although he had a reasonably successful stage career, he found fame when he got the job as Marty Crane, Frasier and Niles\u2019s father, at the age of 53. Here are some other late bloomers who made it: After working as an influential editor in publishing for many years, Athill began writing at 43 and wrote a handful of books. It wasn\u2019t until her memoir, Stet, was published, when she was 83, that Athill became a literary success. Now 100, she has written six more critically acclaimed books. \u201cSuccess in old age, when things have stopped really mattering, has a frivolous sort of charm unlike anything one experiences in middle age,\u201d she once wrote. The actor played Martin Sheen\u2019s presidential secretary in The West Wing and won two Emmys for her role as gossipy neighbour Mrs McCluskey in Desperate Housewives, but Kathryn Joosten only started trying to be an actor in her 40s. She became a Disney street performer in her 50s before moving to Hollywood, getting her big break in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s political drama at 60. The US poet worked on a farm for several years, although he wrote throughout this time. He became an English teacher, before publishing his first book of poetry in 1913 at the age of 39. The fashion designer had an early career as a figure skater, then worked at Vogue for 17 years. After working for fashion designer Ralph Lauren for a couple of years, Wang set herself up as a bridalwear designer at the age of 40 and launched her ready-to-wear collection 10 years later, being named the Council of Fashion Designers of America\u2019s womenswear designer of the year when she was in her mid-50s. Greg Davies was in his mid-30s when he left teaching to become a comic; so was Romesh Ranganathan. Susan Calman was 34 when she left her job as a corporate lawyer to try comedy. Ricky Gervais was in a pop band and worked in radio before he started getting TV comedy jobs in his late 30s; he was 40 when the Office came out.", "title": "It\u2019s never too late: Frasier\u2019s John Mahoney and other older career bloomers"}
