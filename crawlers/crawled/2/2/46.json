It was 100 years to the day since some women and all men in Britain got the vote. The office workers, curious tourists and those passing through this key site in central London where many key suffragette rallies took place, were being encouraged to \u201ctake a selfie with a Suffragette\u201d and remember the campaigners who helped usher in the passing of the Representation of the People Act. The act gave the vote to all men over 21, and women over 30 who had a degree, owned a house or were married to a householder, and paved the way to universal suffrage 10 years later. The Make A Stand pop-up exhibition in the shadow of Nelson\u2019s Column features 59 life-sized images of campaigners, along with famous rallying cries such as \u201cdeeds not words\u201d.  These will be etched on the plinth of the new statue of Millicent Fawcett, created by Gillian Wearing, which, when it is unveiled in spring, will be the first statue of a woman in Parliament Square \u2013 and the first to be made by a woman. The image \u2013 and statue \u2013 feature well-known individuals such as Emily Wilding Davison, who died after throwing herself under the king\u2019s horse at the Epsom Derby in 1913, and Emmeline, Christabel, Sylvia and Adela Pankhurst. It also features Annie Kenney, a northern working-class mill worker who was a celebrity suffragette in her time, disabled campaigner Charlotte Despard who faced police violence in WSPU demonstrations, Henrietta Franklin of the Jewish League for Women\u2019s Suffrage, Laurence Housman of the Men\u2019s League for Women\u2019s Suffrage and Sophia Duleep Singh, a princess of the Indian Raj and the goddaughter of Queen Victoria.  The images and exhibition hoped to highlight the breadth and depth of the women\u2019s suffrage movement, said the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. One of the 52 tiles which feature the images and will go along the base of Wearing\u2019s statue of Fawcett is blank, but honours working-class suffrage speaker Jessie Craigen.  \u201cWe all know the famous suffragists and suffragettes, but they\u2019re all from a certain background,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, the working classes were involved in this campaign as well.\u201d Khan, a self-declared \u201cproud feminist\u201d, added that the centenary year should be seized as an opportunity to further women\u2019s rights, pointing out that the gender pay gap in London remains at 14.6%, down only half a percentage point from 15.1% 20 years ago.  \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that life chances, career prospects, pay \u2013 these are all affected by your gender. That can\u2019t be right in 2018 in the most progressive city in the world,\u201d he said. Historian Lucy Worsley, dressed in full suffragette regalia, said it was a moment to commemorate as well as honour those who fought for the vote. \u201cA lot of these women paid a very heavy price, with their health, in their family life \u2013 this isn\u2019t just a celebration it\u2019s also about remembering the sacrifices they made,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that some of these women would be looking at the world today and thinking there hasn\u2019t been as much progress made as they would have hoped.\u201d The amazing @Lucy_Worsley at #vote100 #behindeverygreatcity centenary celebrations: \u201cit\u2019s not just about celebrations, it\u2019s about remembering the price these women paid\u201d. pic.twitter.com/xg34B7Ad68 Justine Simons, deputy mayor for culture and the creative industries, said she felt \u201cvery emotional\u201d looking at the images of some of the key people involved in the fight for universal suffrage. \u201cI\u2019m struck by just how long it took \u2013 half a century of campaigning for women to get the vote, you can barely believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the job is not done yet. We are incredulous that women couldn\u2019t vote 100 years ago, but we have to be equally incredulous that there is still not gender equality. Achieving that cannot take another 100 years.\u201d One hundred years after some women won the right to vote, the fight for political equality had to continue, said Frances Scott, founder of the 50:50 Parliament group, which has launched the #AskHerToStand campaign to get more women into parliament. \u201cMen still dominate the corridors of power, outnumbering women by more than 2:1 in parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this rate it will take over 50 years for women to have equal seats and equal say in parliament. That is too long to wait.\u201d Emma Thomas, 26, office worker from Norwich It reminds you in the current climate with Trump and Brexit that this is what progress looks like. It\u2019s good to celebrate what they did, but it\u2019s also a call to arms. It\u2019s like they are saying to you: \u201cif we managed to get votes in our time, you can make a difference in yours\u201d. John Subbiah, 67, lay chaplain at St Martin in the fieldsI admire these women hugely \u2013 they played a very important role in politics and in gaining rights for women around the world. I wanted to come down here today because I wanted to honour them. Alison Manning, 63, charity worker for the MND Association I was part of the feminist movement in the 70s and I thought we\u2019d be a lot further on than this. We\u2019ve always lived in a patriarchy and we still do. Seeing these images makes me remember that these women were willing to put their lives on the line and paved the way for us, but too many of us take that for granted. Robert Spicer, 70, retired lawyer My mum was born in 1928 \u2013 the year all women got the vote \u2013 but in her day a letter from the bank would be addressed to her father. It seems totally ridiculous now. Lucy Spouncer, 16, student I think it\u2019s great that all the people who worked so hard for women\u2019s right are being remembered. I\u2019m so grateful to them, and looking at their images it actually makes me feel more confident. I think even today they inspire us to speak out \u2013 don\u2019t be silent, because standing up for what you think is right is the only way things are going to change.", "title": "Suffragettes exhibition in London's Trafalgar Square draws crowds"}
