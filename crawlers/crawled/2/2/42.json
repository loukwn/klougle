Weekend takings of \u00a32.2m take the PT Barnum tale\u2019s total to \u00a323.2m after 41 days.  Distributor Fox is trumpeting the film\u2019s exceptional success. Fox claims that no film has ever before taken the top spot in its sixth week of release, and it\u2019s true that the vast majority of chart-topping films debut at number one. A near precedent occurred back in 2011, when Arthur Christmas rose to No 1 in its fourth week, returning to the summit for its seventh session (which was Christmas weekend).  The Greatest Showman debuted on the last weekend of December with \u00a32.58m (plus previews), then delivered tiny declines of 6%, 11%, 2% and 3%, before posting an 8% rise in the latest chart. The film has delivered six straight weekends with \u00a32m-plus box office \u2013 a feat rarely achieved. The last film to manage it was Paddington (2014).  Since The Greatest Showman has barely declined since its release, it\u2019s impossible to plot a trajectory to calculate where it might end up, but Fox clearly has La La Land\u2019s \u00a330.4m in its sights. The Greatest Showman will receive a boost with the release of a sing-along version on 23 February.  Four films in the Top 10 are nominated for best picture at the Oscars: Darkest Hour, The Post, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and new release Phantom Thread. Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s couture-themed period drama lands in 10th place with an encouraging \u00a3657,000 from 196 cinemas, plus previews. Site average is a robust \u00a33,351 \u2013 the second-highest of any film in the Top 10.  Anderson\u2019s last film Inherent Vice grossed just over \u00a31m in the UK, so distributor Universal will be pleased with the start that Phantom Thread has made: \u00a3727,000, including previews. Before that, The Master maxed out at \u00a31.43m, but Phantom Thread will need a fair bit of box office momentum to catch 2007\u2019s There Will Be Blood (\u00a34.89m).  Debuting in 18th position is Journey\u2019s End, adapted from RC Sherriff\u2019s first world war-set play. Opening box office is \u00a3124,000 from 95 cinemas. Distributor Lionsgate released the film \u2013 which stars Sam Claflin, Asa Butterfield and Paul Bettany \u2013 in time to compete in this year\u2019s Bafta film awards, but nominations did not accrue. And competition is tough, given all the awards-bait dramas on release.  While Journey\u2019s End failed to score awards nominations, Denzel Washington\u2019s best actor Oscar nod seems to have been no help at all for the UK release of his new drama Roman J Israel, Esq. Released into 96 cinemas, it grossed a poor \u00a322,200 for a site average of just \u00a3231. Due to the crush of prestige dramas on release, the film struggled to land bookings in the independent cinemas and boutique chains, where richer outcomes might have resulted.  The numbers for January (the four weeks of cinema play from 5 January to 1 February) show box office dead level with the equivalent period last year. That\u2019s a great outcome for cinemas, since hits including La La Land, Sing and T2 Trainspotting helped push January 2017 to a 20% uptick on 2016.  Despite the lack of commercially potent new releases at the weekend \u2013 heist thriller Den of Thieves, landing in sixth place, did best, with \u00a31.08m \u2013 the session was level with the equivalent frame from 2017. This coming weekend, cinemas welcome franchise finale Fifty Shades Freed, Clint Eastwood\u2019s The 15:17 to Paris and Colin Firth in true tale The Mercy.  1.
