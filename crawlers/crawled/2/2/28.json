Hot Pink is their first new music since 2016\u2019s I, Gemini album, and it\u2019s all good omens: jarring production by PC Music affiliate SOPHIE; spoken-word asides; and a 90s R&B bridge. Which sounds horrible, but put together is weird and incredible. It\u2019s easy to forget that Lily Allen is a talented songwriter, so it\u2019s a relief she\u2019s finally taken a few days away from Twitter to appear on Afrobeats star Burna Boy\u2019s single. Lily\u2019s voice on the hook \u2013 sadly, not about the UFO-obsessed mass-suicide cult \u2013 contrasts Burna\u2019s threats to remove an enemy\u2019s eyes with pliers, but the most shocking part is the video, where he puts his dirty shoes up on a kitchen surface. Hope he\u2019s got the Dettol handy. Justin Timberlake keeps threatening to \u201cgo country\u201d, but with every release off the forthcoming Man of the Woods, fans have heaved a sigh of relief. Not because previous tracks Filthy and Supplies were, you know, good; just because he hasn\u2019t put on a checked shirt and fake-played a guitar yet. Well, y\u2019all: country JT is here, shirt, guitar and all. He\u2019s roped in Kentucky singer Chris Stapleton and is throwing everything into this: there\u2019s harmonising, a choir, and the lyric \u201cSometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all\u201d. Mate, Ronan Keating said\u00a0it better. Yeah, quite a lot of people involved in making this. We\u2019ve got Rudimental and their trumpets, Jess Glynne doing that wobbly voice thing, Macklemore\u2019s croaky rapping and Dan Caplen as Rudimental\u2019s obligatory new and somewhat faceless vocalist. A bit like a chill vibes 21 Seconds, to be honest. Worth watching the video, if only to see an out of place-looking Macklemore pretend to enjoy riding London\u2019s Overground. Part of a surprise drop of two new tracks last week, God\u2019s Plan is \u2026 predictably Drake. He\u2019s a bit miserable, a bit boastful and, yes, of course, the track broke single-day streaming records. God\u2019s Plan also contains the most Drake lyric of all time, where he tells a girl that he only loves her \u201cpartly/ I only love my bed and my momma, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. Same, Aubrey.
