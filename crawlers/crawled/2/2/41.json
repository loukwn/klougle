Thurman accused the writer and director \u2013 known for his ultra-violent films, including Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof and the Kill Bill series \u2013 of bullying her during filming into driving an unsafe car that then crashed, calling the incident \u201cdehumanisation to the point of death\u201d.  \u201cI am guilty, for putting her in that car, but not the way that people are saying I am guilty of it,\u201d Tarantino told Deadline, claiming that nobody in the filming team that day considered the drive a stunt. \u201cIt was just driving. None of us looked at it as a stunt. Maybe we should have, but we didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure when it was brought up to me, that I rolled my eyes and was irritated. But I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t in a rage and I wasn\u2019t livid.\u201d Tarantino supported Thurman\u2019s assertions that he had asked her to drive at a particular speed so that her hair would be blowing. At the last minute, due to concerns about the light changing, the direction of the drive was reversed \u2013 but the road was not tested in this direction before Thurman drove it, Tarantino said.  \u201cI told her it would be OK. I told her the road was a straight line. I told her it would be safe. And it wasn\u2019t. I was wrong. I didn\u2019t force her into the car. She got into it because she trusted me. And she believed me.\u201d On the same day that Tarantino tried to address the resulting criticism, audio also emerged of him apparently defending fellow director Roman Polanski\u2019s sexual assault of a 13-year-old in 1977, saying she was \u201cdown with it\u201d and that rape was a \u201cbuzzword\u201d that didn\u2019t apply to the situation.  In a 2003 interview with Howard Stern, Tarantino said of Polanski: \u201cHe didn\u2019t rape a 13-year-old. It was statutory rape ... he had sex with a minor. That\u2019s not rape. To me, when you use the word rape, you\u2019re talking about violent, throwing them down \u2014 it\u2019s like one of the most violent crimes in the world ... Throwing the word rape around is like throwing the word \u2018racist\u2019 around. It doesn\u2019t apply to everything people use it for ... She wanted to have [sex]! Dated the guy!\u201d Tarantino told the New York Times in October last year that, with regard to the alleged misconduct of film producer Harvey Weinstein: \u201cI knew enough to do more than I did ... I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard.\u201d Tarantino also claimed that it wasn\u2019t until Thurman told him about her own alleged assault at the hands of Weinstein, which paralleled an experience of Tarantino\u2019s then-girlfriend Mira Sorvino, that he realised there was \u201ca pattern\u201d to Weinstein\u2019s \u201cluring and pushing attacks\u201d. He claims he made doing Kill Bill with Miramax conditional on Weinstein apologising to Thurman.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t giving Harvey the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cI knew he was lying, that everything Uma was saying was the truth. When he tried to wriggle out of it, and how things actually happened, I never bought his story. I said, I don\u2019t believe you. I believe her. And if you want to do Kill Bill, you need to make this right.\u201d The crash affected his relationship with Thurman for years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we didn\u2019t talk. But a trust was broken,\u201d he said.  Tarantino agreed with the suggestion that Thurman had been denied access to footage of the crash in order to prevent her from suing, but said he hadn\u2019t been aware she thought he was complicit in that. He said he supplied the footage to Thurman in advance of the New York Times interview because he wanted to make things right.  \u201cThere was an element of closure. She had been denied it, from Harvey Weinstein, being able to even see the footage. I wanted to deliver it to her, so she could look at it. So she could see it and help her with her memory of the incident.\u201d The director also responded to suggestions that he personally performed some of the more controversial and violent actions in his films, including spitting on Thurman\u2019s face and choking her with a chain, by explaining that it was a matter of \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d for tricky shots. He detailed an incident during the filming of Inglourious Basterds in which he asked actor Diana Kruger whether he could personally strangle her in order to get the right shot.  \u201cThat was an issue of me asking the actress, can we do this to get a realistic effect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she agreed with it, she knew it would look good and she trusted me to do it. I would ask a guy the same thing. In fact, I would probably be more insistent with a guy.\u201d  Weinstein has denied assaulting Thuman, as well as all claims of non-consensual sex made against him.", "title": "Tarantino responds to Uma Thurman crash claim: 'The biggest regret of my life'"}
