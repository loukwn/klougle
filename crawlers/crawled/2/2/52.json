But it\u2019s the \u2013futurism that gives Black Panther his distinctive power. Chadwick Boseman plays T\u2019Challa, a prince with a sensitive, handsome, boyish face and something introspective, vulnerable and self-questioning in his style. After the death of his father (shown in Captain America: Civil War, from 2016), T\u2019Challa succeeds to the throne of the fictional African state of Wakanda, which lies west of Lake Victoria, on territory that is occupied in the real world by Uganda, Rwanda and northern Tanzania.  Wakanda is, on the face of it, dirt-poor as well as mountainous, jungly and inaccessible. But the point is that the Wakandans have deliberately cultivated the west\u2019s condescending stereotypes of Africa as camouflage, to prevent outside interference. For beneath the foliage, Wakanda is a secret city state with more flying cars and suspended monorails than you can shake a stick at. It\u2019s a hidden world of supermodernity \u2013 though it is nonetheless the land that democracy forgot. And all powered by the hidden element known as vibranium, which supplies limitless energy, and is harnessed by T\u2019Challa in the armoured bodysuit he wears as Black Panther. T\u2019Challa\u2019s brilliant sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) is his Q figure, a scientist who designs equipment and weaponry. Lupita Nyong\u2019o is Nakia, a Wakandan intelligence agent for whom T\u2019Challa may very well have feelings. Angela Bassett is T\u2019Challa\u2019s widowed mother Ramonda; Forest Whitaker is elder statesman Zuri \u2013 basically, the Merlin of T\u2019Challa\u2019s court \u2013 and Daniel Kaluuya (from Get Out) plays border tribe chief W\u2019Kabi, a man of uncertain loyalties. But there are problems in Wakanda, not all stemming from the film\u2019s few white characters: CIA man Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) blunders into Wakandan power politics, and white South African career criminal Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) plots to steal their vibranium. The Wakandan exile Erik Killmonger (Michael B Jordan) wants to take over T\u2019Challa\u2019s throne and overturn his quietist approach, take advantage of Wakanda\u2019s technological superiority, stand up for racially oppressed African Americans and black people everywhere, and establish a new Wakandan empire of righteousness on which the sun will never set. Our first view of Erik is when he is visiting an exhibition of looted African artefacts in the \u201cMuseum of Great Britain\u201d in London. This setup teases us with its resemblances to Thor and Asgard, as well as its inversions and theme-variants on the Lion King myth, yet it is very much not about a wicked uncle killing a noble king. The vibranium is vitally important; absurd, of course, but very much aligned with all those other natural resources that somehow only enrich people outside Africa: gold, diamonds, rubber and the coltan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that we need for our smartphones. Deadpan, the film allows us to register the difference between T\u2019Challa and Erik as an African and an African American \u2013 Erik being burdened by the traumas and injustices of American history in a way T\u2019Challa is not. It used to be remarked that Barack Obama, born in Hawaii to a Kenyan father, was freed of that burden; his successor, under the impression that there is somewhere in Africa called \u201cNambia\u201d, is not burdened by any great interest in Africa, but perhaps Nambia is his own creative concept neighbouring Wakanda. And where do we go after this? Does Black Panther get to be another subordinate bit-part player in future Marvel ensemble movies? I hope not: I want stories where Black Panther takes on people outside Wakanda and I hope that Nakia gets a movie of her own. The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesn\u2019t look like a superhero film \u2013 more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny.", "title": "Black Panther review \u2013 Marvel's thrilling vision of the afrofuture"}
