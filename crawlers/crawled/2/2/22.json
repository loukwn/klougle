Greta Gerwig, whose very personal, coming-of-age debut film Lady Bird was hotly tipped, lives in New York but happened to be in LA for work. She woke up first at 3.30am: \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not time\u2019 and I forced myself to go back to sleep.\u201d When she eventually surfaced just before seven, the nominations were headlines around the world. Gerwig made herself a coffee, had a shower and ever-so-casually checked her phone. There it was: she\u2019d made the cut for best original screenplay. And \u201cachievement in directing\u201d. Oh, and Lady Bird was in the running for best picture, too. \u201cI started crying and laughing and screaming,\u201d says the 34-year-old Gerwig, who, until now, has been mainly known as an actor, often in comic roles. \u201cAnd it sunk in\u2026 It\u2019s still sinking in. It doesn\u2019t quite feel real. You\u2019re still getting me at peak shock and happiness.\u201d The Oscar selections were a personal triumph for Gerwig and for Lady Bird \u2013 its stars, Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, who play a squabbling daughter and mother, are also nominated \u2013 but it was an important moment for female film-makers everywhere. Gerwig, scarcely credibly, is only the fifth woman ever to be shortlisted in the best director category at the Academy Awards in its 90 years. If she wins on 4 March, she will only be the second, after Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010, to take the honour. \u201cI remember very well when Sofia Coppola was nominated for best director and won best screenplay [for Lost in Translation in 2004] and what that meant to me,\u201d says Gerwig on the phone from New York last week. \u201cAnd I remember when Kathryn Bigelow won for best director and how it seemed as if possibilities were expanded because of it. I genuinely hope that what this means to women of all ages \u2013 young women, women who are well into their careers \u2013 is that they look at this and they think, \u2018I want to go make my movie.\u2019 Because a diversity of storytellers is incredibly important and also I want to see their movies. I want to know what they have to say! So I hope that\u2019s what it does.\u201d These have been a seismic few months for women in the film industry. The allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein and others, while monstrous in their scope and detail, have led to the most positive kind of backlash: through the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, and the 50/50 by 2020 initiative, which aims to have male-female parity in the business world in two years. There\u2019s an optimism that Hollywood has changed for ever. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to shift much more quickly now,\u201d says Gerwig. \u201cWhen studios are looking to hire now, they\u2019ll ask themselves \u2013 as they rightly should \u2013 \u2018Is there a woman who is qualified for this job?\u2019 That\u2019s tremendously important. And again, if I were running a studio, I would think that it\u2019s just good business. Because I look at the audience response to films made by women about women that have done incredibly well and I\u2019d say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s a reason right off the bat.\u2019\u201d As for whether there are any plans for a co-ordinated style protest at this year\u2019s Oscars, in line with the black gowns at the Golden Globes or white roses at the Grammys, both orchestrated by the Time\u2019s Up organisers, Gerwig is unsure. \u201cI am not aware of a dress code,\u201d she says. But if there is, she\u2019s in: \u201cI\u2019m in awe of the people who are collectively working on this.\u201d Gerwig insists she hasn\u2019t dared yet think about how it would feel to win an Oscar. But if the Golden Globes, where Lady Bird took the prize for best film (comedy/musical), is anything to go by, she might well struggle to hold it together. \u201cI had an entire speech prepared but once I got up there, none of it came out,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was looking down and I saw Oprah and Steven Spielberg and I just went into a state of sublime happiness. I think I just said \u2018thank you\u2019 a lot. So my guess would be, I\u2019ll prepare and probably I\u2019ll not say any of it \u2013 if it should happen. Because that\u2019s just how those moments seem to go for me.\u201d When I first talk to Gerwig, on an otherwise regulation Friday during the London film festival, there is a surreal, even comic, imbalance in London\u2019s Soho hotel. Movie stars, it appears, outnumber the rest of us. Bill Nighy stands at a urinal in the men\u2019s room, director Alexander Payne sweeps through the lobby. In the lift up to the suite where Gerwig is doing interviews, who else? The great Christoph Waltz. \u201cChristoph Waltz is here?\u201d she shrieks. The pair became friends when they were on the jury for the Berlin film festival and catch up every so often for dinner in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favourite people; he makes fun of me the entire time,\u201d says Gerwig. \u201cOn the jury, there was this one time where we had a meeting with Angela Merkel. So I wore something that felt appropriate for a daytime lunch with a head of state. And I showed up and Christoph looked at me and said \u2013 she slips into a strident Mitteleuropean accent \u2013 \u2018Greta, are you applying for an internship with Angela?\u2019\u201d Gerwig cracks up. \u201c\u2018Did you bring your resum\u00e9?\u2019 I looked such a nerd.\u201d Payne she knows less well, but is an ardent fan. At the Telluride festival last September, there was a photocall for the film-makers in attendance and Gerwig collected a giant bruise on her leg trying to hurdle a bench to tell Payne how much she liked his latest movie, Downsizing. \u201cI thought, \u2018I must tell him it\u2019s a masterpiece,\u2019\u201d she explains. \u201cSo as I\u2019m jumping over the bench, it clipped my shin and I went sprawling. Everyone turned to look and I looked up at him and I said, \u2018It was a masterpiece!\u2019 And he said, \u2018You could have just walked over.\u2019\u201d Right now, there are plenty of people \u2013 rightly and properly, albeit metaphorically \u2013 tripping over furniture to tell Gerwig that she\u2019s made her own masterpiece. Lady Bird is a beautiful, affectionate rumination on the mother-daughter dynamic that could well be this year\u2019s Moonlight: an underdog that charms and surprises, and overshadows everything else. It is not immediately clear how to square these achievements with Gerwig\u2019s tendency towards self-deprecation. Physically, she mixes elegance with eccentricity. At 5ft 9in, with credulous sea-green eyes, and today wearing a pink, pleated cocktail dress with buckled black-and-white heels, she presents an image of impossible glamour. But she undercuts the effect by slouching a little, laughing unguardedly and demonstrating odd and endearing mannerisms, such as the stiff handshake of a Victorian industrialist packing his son off to boarding school. \u201cI arrived on a flight this morning at 6am, so this is all pretend,\u201d she explains, smoothing an invisible wrinkle on her frock. \u201cI don\u2019t actually feel like this inside. People came to my room and made me look nice. I know, everyone needs it.\u201d Even though it isn\u2019t literally autobiographical there\u2019s a core of emotional truth that\u2019s very resonant In Lady Bird and before, Gerwig is drawn to dreamers: young women who believe they are destined for greatness, even when the audience finds plenty of cause to doubt that. The film follows Ronan as 17-year-old Christine McPherson, who\u2019d rather you call her Lady Bird: when asked if it\u2019s her given name, she clarifies: \u201cIt\u2019s given to me, by me.\u201d The year is 2002, the place is Sacramento, a mid-size city in California, and both these facts are a cruel disappointment to her: \u201cThe only exciting thing about 2002 is that it\u2019s a palindrome,\u201d Lady Bird sighs. She\u2019s in her final year at an all-girls Catholic high school and, after graduating, she wants to move to the east coast to study, \u201cwhere writers live in the woods\u201d. This is one of many, though perhaps the most irreconcilable, point of contention with her mother, Marion (a heart-wrenching Metcalf). It has been a common assumption that Lady Bird is Gerwig\u2019s teenage diaries transcribed. She, too, grew up in Sacramento and attended a Catholic school there, before escaping to the other side of the country, to Barnard College in New York, where she studied English and wanted to become a playwright. But, Gerwig notes, not sniffily, that there are plenty of differences, as well. She didn\u2019t dye her hair pink or assume a strange name or even argue that viciously with her mother. \u201cEven though it isn\u2019t literally autobiographical there\u2019s a core of emotional truth that\u2019s very resonant,\u201d says Gerwig. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not what literally happened, but it does rhyme with the truth. It\u2019s close in a way. And it doesn\u2019t bother me, because it\u2019s the assumption people make and in a way maybe they make that assumption because it feels very real. So it\u2019s not dissimilar to when people think a character is you. Which you could be offended by or you could also think, \u2018Well, then I\u2019ve done my job. You\u2019ve believed it. You think that\u2019s me.\u2019 \u201cBut I don\u2019t know,\u201d she continues. \u201cI think one thing about doing this for a period of time is that you learn how to live through either misconceptions or correct conceptions and just continue doing the work. Because then you figure, \u2018Well, in the end, I\u2019ll just be an old lady one day and then they\u2019ll think, Oh, she\u2019s an old lady.\u2019 And they\u2019ll be right!\u201d What, then, are some solid, hard facts about Gerwig? She is the eldest child of Gordon and Christine, a loans officer for a credit union and a retired nurse respectively. As a child, she was a diligent student with an obsessive streak: her first passion was dancing; later, she would become skilled in the sport of fencing. \u201cI loved ballet,\u201d says Gerwig. \u201cI always knew I wasn\u2019t the most naturally gifted of anyone who was doing ballet. I didn\u2019t have quite enough turn out, my feet weren\u2019t quite right, but I did work harder than anyone else. And I think that\u2019s something I have maintained. There\u2019s no substitute for hard work.\u201d Gerwig acted a little at school but became more serious at college. She saw herself as a theatre person, but when she was rejected from graduate programmes in playwriting, she started working on films with her friends. These no-budget projects became notorious in arty, hipster circles and then beyond, where they were, somewhat derisively, called mumblecore; they were sketched out, but not scripted, and the makers were involved in every aspect of production. \u201cThose became kind of a makeshift film school for me,\u201d says Gerwig, referring to LOL (2006), Hannah Takes the Stairs (2007) and Nights and Weekends (2008), which she made with Joe Swanberg. \u201cWhen I went into pre-production for Lady Bird, I\u2019d been working in films in different capacities for 10 years. Especially on the early little ones because it was an all-hands-on-deck situation. If you weren\u2019t doing something on camera, you held the camera.\u201d These early films, too, led in a roundabout way to Gerwig\u2019s acting breakthrough. Swanberg knew the director Noah Baumbach and he then cast her in his 2010 film Greenberg, opposite Ben Stiller. The film received mixed notices, but Gerwig\u2019s performance caught many eyes. In the New York Times, critic AO Scott described her style as a method without method. \u201cMs Gerwig,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmost likely without intending to be anything of the kind, may well be the definitive screen actress of her generation, a judgment I offer with all sincerity and a measure of ambivalence.\u201d Greenberg was a life-changing experience personally as well: after it wrapped, Gerwig and Baumbach began dating, for a while on the down-low, these days more openly, though Gerwig tends to refer to him as \u201cNoah Baumbach\u201d or \u201cBaumbach\u201d in our interview, suggesting they keep their work and private lives quite distinct. They soon began collaborating and their first film as a writing team was 2012\u2019s Frances Ha, a warm-hearted, black-and-white comedy about a dancer, Frances (Gerwig), who doesn\u2019t seem wholly cut out for the real world. They followed that with Mistress America in 2015, which has a similar vibe: Gerwig plays Brooke, who has a million creative ideas and a very low strike rate. Gerwig\u2019s writing, first with Baumbach and now on her own, has a naturalistic tone that is funny without having jokes, heartbreaking without being schmaltzy, highly specific and yet clearly universal. She is so particular about how the dialogue sounds \u2013 the \u201cmusic\u201d of speech \u2013 that there is a not a single line of improvisation in Lady Bird, not even an added \u201clike\u201d or \u201cyou know\u201d. \u201cI like language that sounds quotidian but poetic,\u201d says Gerwig \u2013 the perfect description. \u201cSomething that maybe the character doesn\u2019t even know is as beautiful as it is. That\u2019s something I was working through when I was writing with Noah Baumbach and I just kept moving in that direction. That was always what I liked. That quality of stumbling into beauty and then it\u2019s gone.\u201d It is a timely moment for Gerwig to emerge as a director and for her debut to have such an assured, idiosyncratic voice. Despite the success of Lady Bird at the Golden Globes in January, Gerwig was a glaring absentee on the best director shortlist. Natalie Portman, presenting the award, made the point succinctly, announcing: \u201cAnd here are the all-male nominees.\u201d Likewise, the Baftas have a five-man shortlist. Of course, this is just one facet of the soul searching that the film industry is now going through. In the week that I meet Gerwig, the first allegations of sexual abuse have been made against Harvey Weinstein, and it was clear that Gerwig found the revelations upsetting and deeply shocking. \u201cI felt so badly for all those women,\u201d she says, \u201cand I felt so understanding of where they were, especially the young women, the women who were in college, the women who were just excited about movies and film-making and found themselves in a position that they didn\u2019t know how to say no, but they didn\u2019t know how to leave and that they felt overpowered and then they felt scared to say anything.\u201d There are tears in her eyes; her voice cracks. \u201cI\u2019ve felt for so long that there just need to be more women in positions of power,\u201d Gerwig goes on. \u201cNot that women are magic or perfect beings, but that they need to have a seat at the table because then I would think that things like this would have far less chance of happening.\u201d When Gerwig realised she was writing about mothers and daughters, she started thinking about movies that covered a similar theme. There were hundreds of films on the father-son relationship, including some excellent ones by Baumbach, but she struggled to think of stories told from the female perspective: James Brooks\u2019s Terms of Endearment (1983) and Mike Leigh\u2019s Secrets and Lies (1996) were among the rare inspirations. \u201cThere are surprisingly few movies about it,\u201d says Gerwig, \u201cand I think that speaks to the fact that there are surprisingly few female film-makers.\u201d I knew I needed actresses who could punch the same weight class and they really can In preparation for shooting Lady Bird, Gerwig created dossiers for her lead characters. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, for example \u2013 who plays Lady Bird\u2019s crush Kyle and is also Oscar-nominated this year for his role in another coming-of- age drama, Call Me By Your Name \u2013 was directed towards the films of \u00c9ric Rohmer and a collection of theoretical essays, The Internet Does Not Exist. Kyle is a pretentious mansplainer: he lectures Lady Bird on how mobile phones are tracking devices for the government and that clove cigarettes have fibreglass in them. At one point, he puts down Howard Zinn\u2019s A People\u2019s History of the United States to announce, \u201cI\u2019m trying to live by bartering alone\u201d. Kyle\u2019s a pseud, but Gerwig clearly has a soft spot for him. \u201cI am not a fan of phones,\u201d she explains. \u201cI talked for a long time with Timoth\u00e9e about his character\u2019s beliefs, and he said, \u2018The funny thing is that everybody is going to think you\u2019re Lady Bird, but you\u2019re Kyle\u2019.\u201d Gerwig laughs, \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018I know! I am secretly Kyle.\u2019 I have all of the same paranoias as Kyle does.\u201d Gerwig is technically a millennial, but not spiritually so. She grew up pre-internet and has no social media presence: \u201cSure, I\u2019ll lurk. But I don\u2019t participate. I\u2019m just a Peeping Tom.\u201d Part of the reason for setting Lady Bird in 2002 is that it\u2019s not \u201ccinematic\u201d to shoot screens. She longs for the pre-phone era when you couldn\u2019t get hold of someone instantly, and the only way to find them would be to drive around to all the locations they might be. We rarely allow ourselves to become properly bored, Gerwig believes, and the internet and smartphones are in part responsible. On the wall of her bedroom, Lady Bird has the Leo Tolstoy quote, \u201cBoredom: the desire for desires.\u201d \u201cBoredom is, I think, pretty useful,\u201d says Gerwig. \u201cYou need to reach a level of boredom to make anything. Because I don\u2019t know if you remember, being bored as a kid, just so bored. You were at a grocery store with your mom and you were like, \u2018It\u2019s just excruciating!\u2019 But then you get to a point where you start making up a game for yourself or you\u2019ll start imagining things or whatever it is. But I worry that we\u2019ve lost that capacity, which I think maybe erodes some creativity as well. \u201cI\u2019m just as bad as anyone,\u201d she admits. \u201cBecause it\u2019s like your flitting brain can be completely satisfied by this machine that can give you feedback for all of your passing thoughts. Like, \u2018Where can you grow avocados?\u2019 I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s find out. And then, \u2018Oh, how much water does an avocado tree take every year?\u2019 Let\u2019s look at that. And then, \u2018Different crops and the water usage for each of them.\u2019 You are creating this weird feedback loop for yourself.\u201d This is a very Gerwigian conundrum: hem-hawing about restricting access to the internet because she\u2019s worried she\u2019ll waste time Googling avocados. But she\u2019s not saying it to be cute. It clearly concerns her. One of the strict directives on the set of the Lady Bird was that it was entirely phone-free. \u201cAnd not just for the actors, for the crew,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s quite depressing for an actor to be doing an emotional scene and look over and see someone checking Instagram. It\u2019s a real bummer. But it was quite impressive, because I had a lot of young people in this movie and none of them ever brought their phones to set. Saoirse set the tone: I never saw her on her phone, never once.\u201d Gerwig is effusive about her two stars, Ronan and Metcalf. Everything in the film, she says, comes back to \u201cthe central love story\u201d between Marion and Christine, mother and daughter. \u201cFor all of time it\u2019s probably been the most rich, fraught relationship. Something with Laurie and Saoirse that I loved was that they were the same height and I gave them the same haircuts so that when they were in profile, you say: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re so at odds with each other but actually you\u2019re the same. And that\u2019s why the fighting is so intense because you guys can both bring it.\u2019 \u201cSo I knew I needed actresses who could punch the same weight class,\u201d Gerwig adds. \u201cThey give extraordinary performances and they should get all the statues and prizes. Work like that should be rewarded.\u201d For her part, whatever happens, Gerwig insists that little will change. She will keep acting \u2013 when the project and specifically the director is right \u2013 and she wants to collaborate with Baumbach again: \u201cI hope Noah and I will write another movie together because it\u2019s really, really fun.\u201d She also wants to start her own production company one day. \u201cIt\u2019s important that if you have any kind of a platform and it matters to you that you should figure out how to bring other people along,\u201d she says. As for the Oscars, she is not about to pretend that she\u2019s not freaking out a little. \u201cI grew up watching all the award shows and I\u2019d put on a fancy dress and watch it with my friends,\u201d Gerwig recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling and it\u2019s also part of what the dream of making films is.\u201d Then Gerwig\u2019s eyes narrow; these are defining moments both for her personally as a director and also as an inspirational member of the too-small band of female film-makers. \u201cBut awards are not important in terms of whether or not I\u2019ll make another film,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll keep making films, no matter what.\u201d Lady Bird is in selected cinemas from 16 February and nationwide from 23 February", "title": "Greta Gerwig: 'I'm at peak shock and happiness'"}
