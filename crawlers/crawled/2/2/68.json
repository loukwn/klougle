On to these yellow bricks comes Grammy award-winning Texan Kacey Musgraves, fresh from a Radio 2 session with Ken Bruce (before an audience of six million, she tells us later), on the opening night of her UK tour. Despite her gorgeous voice and poster-girl beauty, she\u2019s different, is Kacey. Her 2013 single Follow Your Arrow marked her out as a provocateur in her genre: she advocated kissing girls \u201cif you want to\u201d, and rolling joints, and railed against misogyny. Her recent album, Golden Hour, also has an offbeat inspiration: taking acid, although the source of its mood of wide-eyed wonder isn\u2019t immediately obvious. More evident is Musgraves\u2019 huge talent as a mainstream singer-songwriter, her songs aiming for the universal reach of Fleetwood Mac, with added disco glitter. Even before the show starts, all signs point away from cowboy-booted earthiness towards high-octane, edgy pop. Her support act is the hugely melodic 90s indie revivalist Soccer Mommy; her pre-show music includes Tame Impala and Blondie. A glitterball twirls above a lit-up walkway, then the lights fade to black, and the dry ice goes into overdrive. When Musgraves appears through the mist, though, she\u2019s as down-home as you like. Her long black hair trails down the back of a loudly patterned paisley suit, lightly dappled with rhinestones. Her new songs peal out: Slow Burn, extolling the virtues of doing things your own way (\u201ctaking my time, let the world turn\u201d), Butterflies, celebrating romance to a swinging, tinkling, early-60s piano (\u201cI came out new / All because of you\u201d). Musgraves was recently married, she reminds us a few songs in, which might explain her new focus on more universal themes; her move away from rootsier, banjo-fuelled short stories might also be because of an eye on somewhat broader horizons. She seems happiest when she steps away from the microphone, away from the amplification The fly in the ointment, though, is Musgraves\u2019 on-stage persona. She\u2019s oddly cold, rarely smiling, often tapping at her in-ear mic. The sound mixing doesn\u2019t help, with her clever lyrics lost in a high volume better suited to a bigger arena. Her band are fantastic, though: drums, pedal steel, cello, double bass, guitars and 70s synthesisers all creating a fantastic brew of sound. They\u2019re especially affecting when they decamp to the front of the stage, playing songs like the characterful Family Is Family from 2015\u2019s Pageant Material. \u201cFamily is family, in church or in prison,\u201d Musgraves sings, finally relaxing a little. \u201cYou get what you get, and you don\u2019t get to pick \u2019em.\u201d Oddly enough, she seems happiest when she steps away from the microphone, away from the amplification, when she can actually hear herself sing. That said, her full-blown pop moments are frequently fabulous. High Time sounds utterly blissful tonight, a megawatt cinematic torch song about remembering who you are (its whistling riff having echoes of Morricone\u2019s theme in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly). Set-closer High Horse also shows how country can be melded brilliantly with late-70s, Chic-like disco, pointing towards a style with which Musgraves could truly conquer the world. The lyrics also feature her returning to her wisecracking best, sneering at a man who thinks he\u2019s first place, to a finger-clicking beat. \u201cYeah, someone should give you a ribbon,\u201d she jeers, joyously, to a crowd on their feet. Her golden hour\u2019s out there somewhere. \u2022 Touring until 6 November", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/24/kacey-musgraves-review-bristol-hippodrome"}
