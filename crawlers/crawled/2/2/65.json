Marcello, a dogsitter living in a seedy Roman suburb, becomes the target of a local hoodlum who is putting the squeeze on neighbourhood businesses. Lead Marcello Fonte turns in a superb performance. (Michael Moore, 2018, US) 128 mins With a title that tweaks his enormously successful anti-Bush doc Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore attempts to do the same for Donald Trump. Moore is certainly still a watchable to-camera talker, but given that Trump-baiting is now standard on TV, this was never likely to have the impact of its predecessor. Still, worth a look. (Jean Cocteau, 1950, Fr) 95 mins Before the idea of an auteur became a reality, Cocteau represented the acme of the cinematic artist. Poet, novelist, dramatist and all-round avant gardist, Cocteau\u2019s cinema tended to infuse psychodrama with mythic motifs, rarely bettered than here in his 1950 version of the Orpheus story. Jean Marais plays a poet summoned to a mysterious, dreamlike \u201czone\u201d. (Damien Chazelle, 2018, US) 141 mins Ryan Gosling is in the hot seat, thundering off to the moon in Chazelle\u2019s uplifting if conventional treatment of the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, the climax to the United States\u2019s great space adventure. Gosling plays Neil Armstrong as reticent and publicity shy; we will never know how true a depiction this is, since the real man was ... well, reticent and publicity shy. (Bradley Cooper, 2018, US) 135 mins Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper collaborate to impressive effect in this latest remake of Hollywood\u2019s favourite story: the ingenue who is discovered by, then eclipses, her world-weary mentor. Gaga, in her biggest role to date, does a bang-up job while Cooper, making his directorial debut as well as acting, captures everything with a practised ease. AP Over the space of three albums, Texas-born Kacey Musgraves has emerged as country music\u2019s true outlaw, offering a tonic to the lyrical cliches of \u201cbro-country\u201d. This year\u2019s Golden Hour also moved her closer to pop perfection, setting her precise songwriting in a disco-tinged context and upstaging recent country-pop hybrids by Miley Cyrus (Younger Now) and Lady Gaga (Joanne).Bristol Hippodrome, Tuesday 23; York Barbican, Wednesday 24; Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, Friday 26 October; touring to 3 November To mark the, erm, 13th anniversary of their debut album, Silent Alarm, Bloc Party \u2013 AKA the original lineup\u2019s Kele Okereke and Russell Lissack, plus new-ish members Justin Harris and Louise Bartle \u2013 will play the whole thing in full. Fingers crossed it\u2019s not performed in order or you\u2019ll be knackered by track two, the evergreen banger Helicopter.3Arena, Dublin, Monday 22; Alexandra Palace, N22, Wednesday 24 October Australian art-pop collective Haiku Hands have a way with a lyric. For example, last year\u2019s pogoing single, Not About You, features the following call to arms: \u201cI\u2019m going to tear up the lexicon with a hexagon and my sexy thong on.\u201d Same. With new single, Squat, continuing their passion for the surreal, expect an evening of properly off-kilter pop exuberance.Bristol, Saturday 20; Brighton, Monday 22; London, Tuesday 23; Leeds, Wednesday 24; Edinburgh, Thursday 25; touring to 27 October Hailed as \u201can indie rock prodigy\u201d by Rolling Stone, 19-year-old Lindsey Jordan, AKA Snail Mail (pictured below), documents teenage ennui without wallowing. Her critically adored debut album, Lush, released in the summer, reflects 90s grunge but also feels modern, referencing the likes of Taylor Swift, Frank Ocean and Paramore.Birmingham, Sunday 21; Leeds, Monday 22; Glasgow, Tuesday 23; Manchester, Wednesday 24; London, Thursday 25; touring to 31 October MC From Miles Davis poignancy to Celtic folk to jazz-injected synthpop and beyond, trumpeter-composer Laura Jurd keeps on resynthesising any musics that take her fancy. Her Mercury-nominated quartet Dinosaur, plus the US\u2019s celebrated Mingus Big Band, UK great Chris Barber and others are helping Middlesbrough to launch its first major jazz festival in 40 years.Town Hall, Middlesbrough, Saturday 20 & Sunday 21 October JF The London Sinfonietta\u2019s contribution to Kings Place\u2019s Time Unwrapped season is a neatly planned three-part programme. Each element will begin precisely on the hour, and consist of works that treat the role of time in music in different ways. So, the first part is devoted to a selection of Conlon Nancarrow\u2019s Player Piano Studies; the second to Morton Feldman\u2019s Bass Clarinet and Percussion and Steve Reich\u2019s Four Organs; while the last juxtaposes Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s Pulse Sampler for oboe and claves, with Stockhausen\u2019s early masterpiece Zeitmasse.Kings Place, N1, Saturday 20 October Whenever Ilan Volkov goes back to the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, where he was chief conductor from 2003 to 2009, he brings something fresh and unexpected. This time, it is a programme of Frank Zappa, Julian Anderson and Charles Ives. The Scottish premiere of Anderson\u2019s The Imaginary Museum, the piano concerto he wrote for Steven Osborne, is sandwiched between Zappa\u2019s The Perfect Stranger and Ives\u2019s exuberant New England Holidays Symphony.City Halls, Glasgow, Thursday 25 October Works by Berlioz form the core of Ludovic Morlot\u2019s latest concert with the BBC Philharmonic, but are book- ended with music by Kaija Saariaho. Morlot opens with the Finn\u2019s Laterna Magica, written for the Berlin Philharmonic in 2009, and ends with Earth\u2019s Shadows, Saariaho\u2019s 2013 score for organ and orchestra: not an organ concerto, the composer has emphasised, but \u201ca fruitful and inspiring companionship\u201d.Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Friday 26 October AC The art of Islam, in which abstract beauty mingles with the power of words, gets a sumptuous new display in this journey through space and time. Metalwork from 12th-century Herat and glass from medieval Egypt and Syria are shown alongside modern work that reinvents Islamic traditions.British Museum, WC1, permanent The cut-up words and images of Jamie Reid shaped the look of punk from 1976. His aesthetic is a mixture of German dada montages made in 1919 with the sinister violence of blackmail letters. This is the eternal rebel\u2019s first major retrospective. The Queen probably won\u2019t be visiting.Humber Street Gallery, Hull, to 6 January The paintings of this late Victorian artist are a love-it-or-loathe-it mixture of Arthurian legend, William Morris nostalgia and ethereal symbolism. The case for his vision is that it not only creates a vivid imaginary world but also points the way to modern abstract art and was revolutionary in its day. The case against is that it is all so skin-deep and forgettable: a kind of anodyne, sexless Victorian answer to Game of Thrones.Tate Britain, SW1, Wednesday 24 October to 24 February Stonehenge has been in public care for a century but it has long fascinated artists: Constable drew it; Blake appropriated it in his personal mythology; and Thomas Hardy sent his characters to its lonely setting. Today, you have to get up very early to be alone there. The centenary celebrations include Jeremy Deller\u2019s bouncy castle version while, in this new exhibition, you can explore the Neolithic world that created it.English Heritage: Stonehenge, nr Salisbury, to 21 April The Russian Revolution got a lot of publicity last year for its centenary but this exhibition unlocks one of its darkest episodes. Monarchs deposed in previous revolutions \u2013 Charles I of England, Louis XVI of France and his queen Marie Antoinette \u2013 were at least tried and executed in public. In 1918, the last tsar of Russia and his family were murdered in secret by their Bolshevik captors, a hint of the violence to come in Stalin\u2019s purges.Science Museum, SW7, to 24 March JJ Actor and playwright Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s show Misty, directed by Omar Elerian, sold out at the Bush Theatre, transferred to the West End and has now been extended. Rap, reggae, standup, spoken word and performance art all feature in this surreal odyssey through inner London, highlighting the changing city, the creative process and racial stereotypes.Trafalgar Studios, SW1, to 17 November Who doesn\u2019t love a satirical psychological thriller about real estate? Martin Crimp actually premiered Dealing With Clair 30 years ago at the Orange Tree. It finds an upwardly thrusting yuppie couple doing everything to screw their vendor; meanwhile, their estate agent has gone missing. Richard Twyman directs.Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, Friday 26 October to 1 December Women in the army is the subject of this co-production by Sheffield Theatres and Out of Joint. Kate Bowen\u2019s play follows three very different but equally determined, pioneering women who are elite soldiers. Having shown supreme skill and discipline in training, they arrive to serve in the British infantry in close-combat roles. Meanwhile, some are saying they shouldn\u2019t be on the frontline at all \u2026Crucible Studio, Sheffield, Thursday 25 October to 10 November Writer Chris Thorpe and director Sam Pritchard have journeyed to towns and villages across England to create a modern take on the travelling mystery plays, looking at the landscape and how we live together. Each of the six plays \u2013 set in Stoke-on-Trent, Eskdale, Staindrop, Boston, Whitby and Manchester, from a sheep farm to a tourist information centre \u2013 has been premiered in the place it was written before this complete run of all of them in Manchester.Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, Thursday 25 October to 11 November A fine cast, including Henry Goodman and Imogen Stubbs, are in this revival of Australian writer Joanna Murray-Smith\u2019s astute and intense drama concerning the nature of love and shifts in power, as a couple\u2019s 32-year-old marriage is threatened by a much younger woman. Murray-Smith\u2019s work includes Switzerland, the well-received Patricia Highsmith play recently seen in Bath.Park Theatre, N4, Thursday 25 October to 24 November MC The script here comes from poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, the music is by Murray Gold, and Michele Clapton of Game of Thrones designed the costumes. Liv Lorent has good taste in collaborators, and her warped, fantastical take on the Grimm brothers tale is a kids\u2019 show that\u2019s just as appealing to adults.Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Friday 26 & 27 October; touring to 17 November An under-the-radar choreographer who has moments of brilliance, Recacha\u2019s latest full-length work is an absurd ode to pointlessness. Two women are stuck in limbo, in a duet inspired by the social isolation of motherhood and our post-everything world.Lilian Baylis Studio, EC1, Thursday 24 & Friday 25 October Patel picked up an award for this show at March\u2019s Adelaide fringe, and this is the last date on her UK tour. The exquisite bharatanatyam dancer blends that form with contemporary dance and theatre to address the whitewashing of history.Birmingham Hippodrome, Tuesday 23 October LW  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
