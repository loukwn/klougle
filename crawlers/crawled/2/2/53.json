A new show relives those heady days \nJudith Mackrell \n\nTue 6 Feb 2018 17.11\u00a0GMT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 6 Feb 2018 17.47\u00a0GMT\n\n When the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury in 1948, the Trinidadian singer Lord Kitchener was among the 492 Caribbean passengers arriving to begin a new life in Britain. Journalists mobbing the Essex docks asked the jauntily debonair Kitch to sing for them and, barely missing a beat, he responded with his newly composed calypso, London Is the Place for Me.  Kitch\u2019s optimistic lyrics embodied the hopes of the estimated 170,000 Caribbeans who would follow him over the next decade or so. They were drawn by the 1948 British Nationality Act, which gave them rights of settlement, and by a huge advertising campaign in which Britain promised excellent jobs and wages to all those who would come to help rebuild the nation after the devastation of war. \u201cThey had a good home in Jamaica,\u201d says Sharon Watson, director of Phoenix Dance Theatre, which has created a new work to mark the 70th anniversary of that first wave of immigration. \u201cBut they felt that a call for help had come out from the motherland. They were part of a generation who held England in such high esteem that they believed it was their duty to respond.\u201d Windrush: Movement of the People is based partly on Watson\u2019s own parents\u2019 journey from Jamaica to Leeds in the 1950s, emphasising the loyalty that motivated them to go through such an upheaval. It felt horribly poignant to Watson that, having set out for the UK with such high-minded hopes, her parents encountered so much cruelty. The racism of 1950s Britain was brutal, Watson says. \u201cMy mother wept and wept once she started telling me about it: \u2018When the call came out we answered it. But we arrived to all these notices saying: No dogs, no blacks, no Irish. That really hurt.\u2019\u201d Equally shocking was the standard of living. \u201cMy parents thought they would be lush with money. But the wages were so meagre, people were living one family to a room.\u201d  Worst of all perhaps, her mother and father had to come to the UK without their children. It would be nine years before they could afford to fly all five over. So Watson, who was born in Leeds, did not meet her youngest brother until he was 14. Yet for all the grimness of her parents\u2019 initial struggles, Watson has chosen to also focus on the successes they and so many others made of their lives, highlighting the profound ways in which the Windrush generation went on to shape the culture of their new home. Researching the subject with composer Gary Crosby, Watson was fascinated by the impact Caribbean dance and music made on Britain. Calypso, with its melodious syncopations and witty innuendo, won an enthusiastic audience. In 1957, Harry Belafonte\u2019s recording of The Banana Boat Song (Day-O) reached No 3 in the UK charts. But the early Caribbean arrivals also brought gospel and their own take on country and western. \u201cEveryone in Jamaica used to listen to it on American pirate radio,\u201d says Watson.  The younger immigrants brought the cooler, more politicised music of ska, rocksteady and reggae. As these mixed with the established lingua franca of jazz and R&B, new hybrids began to appear: northern soul, lovers rock, two tone and dub. The music that accompanies the final scene of Watson\u2019s work tells its own story: \u201cThere\u2019s some Jim Reeves in there, Louisa Mark, a dub step track, Jocelyn Brown and Amazing Grace.\u201d Along with the music came the dances: the ska-inspired skanking, for instance, whose rapid footwork and punching arm movements became popular with mods in the 60s. In 1955, Lambeth town hall had done its bit for racial integration by holding a \u201cNo colour bar dance\u201d where local white dancers were encouraged to try out the mambo, while their black neighbours experimented with the foxtrot.  Yet what interests Watson is not so much the migration of specific steps to Britain, but the more generalised impact that Caribbean communities made on the nation\u2019s dancing habits. The expense, as well as the cultural awkwardness of dancing in white clubs and dance halls, meant that they often preferred to hold parties in their own confined living rooms. Watson can still remember the crowded lovers rock and blues parties that became a defining feature of the Jamaican community in Leeds. \u201cThey would start very late, at midnight, and go on until the early hours,\u201d she says. \u201cThere would be almost no light, a lot of alcohol, probably a lot of smoking, and the space would be so squeezed you\u2019d have people dancing right up against your back.\u201d These intimate house parties were very different from the public spaces in which the British had habitually danced. But, by the late 60s and 70s, they had become the norm. So too had the rapt, improvised style of movement employed by young white people as they tried to approximate the hip-swaying, loose-jointed, African-inflected influences of the Caribbean. Watson has referenced some of those influences in her own choreography. But she has deliberately restricted them to a flavour rather than a literal re-creation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the work to become a history lesson,\u201d she says. \u201cIt needs to be theatrical, to connect with the audience.\u201d  Windrush is her first fully narrative work and, while she\u2019s been apprehensive about the challenges of sustaining character and storyline, she\u2019s proud of having engaged with so historic a subject. She has been astonished by the number of people wanting to share their stories, including the granddaughter of the Windrush\u2019s captain. \u201cI feel as though my dancers and I have become part of a landmark event,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve lived every aspect it.\u201d  \u2022 Windrush: Movement of the People is at West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, 7 to 10 February. Then touring until 10 May.", "title": "Do the mambo! How the Windrush brought a dance revolution to Britain"}
