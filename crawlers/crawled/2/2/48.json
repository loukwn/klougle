Now, they\u2019re film stars. Where will their extraordinary lives go next? \nEmine Saner \n\nTue 6 Feb 2018 06.00\u00a0GMT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 6 Feb 2018 11.43\u00a0GMT\n\n The only moment during filming that felt truly like a flashback, says Spencer Stone, was when he was crouching by the bleeding man on the floor of the train carriage, his finger pressed into his neck wound to try to stop the blood. \u201cWe\u2019re saying the same things we said to each other, we\u2019re on the train, we\u2019re wearing the same clothes, they recreated our injuries so we\u2019re all covered in blood again,\u201d says Stone. \u201cThere is the insane amount of blood that I remember.\u201d Like Stone, the man on the floor is not an actor, but Mark Moogalian, the actual person who lived the events of 21 August 2015, when a gunman, armed with weapons including an AK-47 and almost 300 rounds of ammunition, allegedly attempted to commit a terrorist atrocity. \u201cI just completely forgot anyone was there,\u201d says Stone, \u201cand once they said: \u2018Cut\u2019, I was like: \u2018Oh, there are other people [here]\u2019 and I looked up and Clint Eastwood was standing in front of us looking at the monitor.\u201d He had a strange expression on his face, remembers Stone, which he can\u2019t really describe; so did the crew.  Stone locked eyes with his friend Anthony Sadler, who was a short way away on the train carriage. \u201cI kind of gave him a look like, \u2018That was it\u2019, for the first and only time during shooting we might as well have all been on the train in 2015 again,\u201d remembers Sadler. \u201cEverybody felt that, even the crew. It felt as real as it gets. Basically, they saw what happened in real time.\u201d Two and a half years ago, three young Americans \u2013 Stone, then 22, Sadler, 23, and their friend Alek Skarlatos, 22 \u2013 were on a tour of Europe. Friends since school, it was a reunion of sorts (Skarlatos and Sadler hadn\u2019t seen each other for some years). On a train from Amsterdam to Paris, the three \u2013 along with British businessman Chris Norman, and Moogalian, who apprehended the man first \u2013 stopped an alleged attempted terrorist attack. They were soon on their way home to Sacramento, California, but not before picking up the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, France\u2019s highest decoration. Today, they are back in the city, in a grand hotel suite, lounging, legs on tables, to promote the film The 15:17 from Paris, directed by Eastwood, in which they play themselves. The atmosphere is slightly hysterical \u2013 the three are hyped-up on jetlag, attention, sports drinks and the path that the train journey has taken them on. Stone was a staff sergeant in the US air force; Skarlatos was a specialist in the Oregon national guard; Sadler was a kinesiology student at the University of California. Now, all three would like to be movie stars. \u201cWe enjoyed it so much and we had such a great opportunity working with Mr Eastwood that we have to at least give it a shot,\u201d says Skarlatos. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will work out or not.\u201d He has just taken acting classes; Stone is about to. It has been a unique experiment by modern Hollywood standards, if not historic (the former US soldier Audie Murphy played himself in To Hell and Back in 1955, but he had already been an actor for a number of years by then), and all three do a remarkable job. It\u2019s incredibly moving when the real footage of them, young and a bit bewildered, wearing hastily borrowed clothes at the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur ceremony, is spliced in. They met Eastwood when he presented them with an award in 2016. Backstage, joking, they asked if he would be interested in directing a film of their story. They had a book coming out, and he asked them to send it to him. They did, and they received a call soon afterwards to say Eastwood wanted to film it. Three weeks before shooting started, he called them to Los Angeles. \u201cThey\u2019d been casting the movie for a while so we assumed we were going down there to meet the actors who were playing us and he basically said: \u2018Do you guys think you could do it again for us?\u2019\u201d says Skarlatos. \u201cWe thought he meant to re-enact it to show the actors how to do the fight scene. He rephrased it because he could tell we didn\u2019t understand. We were like, \u2018Are you asking us to be in the movie?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 The second he left the room the reality of the situation set in \u2013 he\u2019s taking a huge risk on us, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to pull it off.\u201d They asked for 24 hours to think about it. Were any of them not keen? \u201cI was but only because of the fact that these things just don\u2019t happen, people don\u2019t play themselves,\u201d says Sadler. \u201cI was like, actors can do it and it will be a way better movie. We were all on the phone and Spencer said: \u2018Twenty years from now, are you going to say you could have been in your own movie directed by Clint Eastwood but you told him no?\u2019 That was enough for me.\u201d About the sum total of their acting experience belonged to Skarlatos, who had been in school and church plays. \u201cHe played, like, a tree,\u201d says Stone and they all collapse into laughter. \u201cI was an alligator,\u201d says Skarlatos. Stone puts on a pedantic voice, mocking his friend: \u201cFor your information, I was a crocodile.\u201d Skarlatos, mock-frustrated now, while Sadler has doubled up in laughter on the sofa: \u201cI was an alligator, they\u2019re different!\u201d Did they have acting lessons? \u201cDoubt started to creep in, and we were like: \u2018Hey, Mr Eastwood, thanks for the opportunity, but we feel like we\u2019re going to need some acting classes,\u2019\u201d says Stone. \u201cHe pretty much just said no because he didn\u2019t want it to look like we were acting, he wanted us to be natural and be ourselves and do things exactly how it happened.\u201d They all admit to nerves and feeling self-conscious on the first day of filming. \u201cNot having known him too well, I\u2019m looking for, I don\u2019t know, a standing ovation after each scene,\u201d says Sadler. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, just any reaction and he doesn\u2019t give reactions like that, he doesn\u2019t say if it\u2019s good or bad, so we all had to learn through the process what he liked and didn\u2019t like. If he was moving on in the scene it was like, OK, he got it, he was happy with our performance.\u201d Skarlatos, seeing the huge number of people who make up a film shoot, suddenly felt the pressure to do a good job. Stone says he remembers going through \u201ca crash-and-burn-type feeling. All your insecurities are firing on all cylinders. It was just something I felt I had to get over. I almost feel like playing someone else would be a little easier.\u201d Sadler says: \u201cI feel like we all had at least one day that we were like, \u2018Man, I\u2019m kind of messing this up.\u2019\u201d What did Eastwood want from them? \u201cHe wanted us to be ourselves,\u201d says Stone. \u201cHe kept it really simple with us because we hadn\u2019t acted before. That\u2019s his style really anyway, he doesn\u2019t over-direct. He was basically saying: \u2018This only happened two years ago, you\u2019re with your two best friends, if you\u2019re having a beer, have a beer and talk to your friend.\u2019 And don\u2019t worry about the script, the camera, just enjoy being with your friends, and we\u2019ll capture it.\u201d It felt natural, doing it with friends, says Skarlatos, having \u201cthe same conversations we would normally have. Even if the acting is not so good, it\u2019s definitely true to who we are as people. We watched the movie with our friends and family, and they could tell it was us on screen, it\u2019s not like we were being fake or trying to be somebody else for the camera.\u201d It must have been a surreal experience. \u201cVery surreal,\u201d says Skarlatos. \u201cWearing the same clothes, doing the same stuff. It was only two years ago so we\u2019ve remembered almost everything. We used a lot of things we actually said in real life.\u201d \u201cFor us,\u201d says Sadler, \u201cit\u2019s special because we\u2019ll be able to look back on it and be like, that is truly us in 2015 and that time in our lives.\u201d For most people, it would perhaps be a time they would rather not remember \u2013 or relive. In the train carriage, Stone was dozing with headphones on when a member of the train staff in uniform sprinted past him. The door to the carriage slid open and he says Moroccan national Ayoub el-Khazzani, then 25, entered, carrying an AK-47 and a backpack on his chest packed with \u2013 they would later find out \u2013 hundreds of rounds of ammunition. By then Stone was crouched between the seats. A split-second later, he was up \u2013 6ft 3in and heavily built \u2013 and charged at el-Khazzani down the aisle. He knew he was about to get peppered with bullets, he writes in his book, but thought maybe it would delay the gunman enough to give the others a chance. \u201cIn the moment I wasn\u2019t thinking about much,\u201d says Stone, \u201cbut looking back and being able to evaluate what I saw, it was really just because we had nowhere to go. We were on a moving train in the middle of the countryside, he\u2019s got an automatic weapon and it was either just sit there and wait for him to walk up and shoot us, or try and do something.\u201d El-Khazzani took aim, but miraculously the gun jammed. They fell to the floor and the fight began, soon joined by Skarlatos, during which the gunman would bring out a pistol and attempt to shoot Stone with that, then bring out a knife. Stone suffered slashes to the back of his neck and his thumb was nearly severed. He managed to get el-Khazzani in a chokehold, and eventually the Moroccan passed out. Once he had been subdued, and while Skarlatos and the British man, Chris Norman, were restraining him using neckties, Stone went over to Moogalian, who had been shot in the neck, and staunched the blood loss. About half an hour later, the train pulled into the station at Arras and police and paramedics took over. What was it like to relive that violent scene? \u201cIt was a lot of fun, really,\u201d says Skarlatos, although he says it was \u201csurreal and strange. We were wearing the same clothes, with the same people [including Moogalian, his wife, many of the train staff]. We\u2019re on a train. Ray [Corasani, the actor playing el-Khazzani] looked very much like the [alleged] terrorist.\u201d It wasn\u2019t, he says, \u201ca traumatic or negative thing for us. But seeing the same things again, it made it very easy to feel the same emotions and feel scared, or angry or [experience that] adrenaline rush.\u201d Nobody died, he points out. Moogalian survived, and Skarlatos doesn\u2019t have to live with what it might be like to have killed el-Khazzani (they say he was trying to stab Stone, who was holding him from behind, and Skarlatos put the gunman\u2019s AK-47 to his head and pulled the trigger, but it didn\u2019t fire; had it done, it would likely have killed Stone as well). Was it cathartic? They all say it was. \u201cWe worked through the same things, and we learned a lot about [el-Khazzani\u2019s] life we didn\u2019t know,\u201d says Skarlatos. \u201cIt was nice to tell the story once and for all, because we\u2019re doing it in a Clint Eastwood movie, which is about the biggest [way] you can tell anything.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re proud of this but we have the rest of our lives to live,\u201d says Sadler. \u201cThis is kind of like a stamp on the chapter, and we can hopefully move on.\u201d They say they really only think about the attack when they are asked about it in interviews. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that rules our thoughts,\u201d says Stone. \u201cWe don\u2019t let it cripple us.\u201d Do they dwell on the what-ifs? What if they had run instead of fought? What if the alleged terrorist \u2013 el-Khazzani is awaiting trial in France and denies terrorism charges \u2013 had managed to kill one of them, and gone on to shoot many more? \u201cI do,\u201d says Sadler. \u201cYou can\u2019t help it, especially when you see a new headline and it\u2019s always a number, a tally: 50 people dead, five people dead. How easy we could have been, should have been, one of those numbers.\u201d Would they have done anything differently? \u201cNo, I think everything worked out the best way it could,\u201d says Stone. \u201cEven when we consider the option of what if we did decide to run, even if we would have made it out alive, we couldn\u2019t live with ourselves knowing we had the opportunity to do something and we chose to go the other way. I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy my life with that decision. I would rather have died.\u201d The film makes a big play about how these young men are heading towards this destiny. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say it exactly like that, but it was based off real conversations that we had,\u201d says Stone. All three have a strong religious faith (they met at a Christian school, were regular churchgoers and Sadler\u2019s father is a pastor) and have said they believe they were guided and protected by God on that day. \u201cAt the time we didn\u2019t realise it,\u201d says Skarlatos, \u201cbut looking back, it\u2019s kind of like everything we did in our lives did prepare us for the train attack in some way.\u201d The film is selling itself as ordinary people doing something extraordinary, but that\u2019s an over-optimistic reading of the event \u2013 after all, it was Stone\u2019s jujitsu training and battlefield medical knowledge that subdued the gunman and saved Moogalian\u2019s life; it was Skarlatos\u2019s military training that allowed him to attempt to use, then make safe, the guns. But their bravery and willingness for self-sacrifice is nonetheless inspiring. The attack has changed their lives \u2013 the awards, the invitation to meet Barack Obama at the White House, the chatshows, the potential movie careers. How has it changed them? \u201cIt makes me grateful for every day that we have because we all know that we could have died that day,\u201d says Skarlatos. Sadler says the same, adding, \u201cYou survive something like that, so you don\u2019t find yourself wasting time over that small stuff any more.\u201d Stone says it has changed him \u201cin that I live day by day at this point. People ask me: \u2018What are you doing with your life? What\u2019s your plan?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I feel like it\u2019s a gift to be in the mindset I\u2019m in, living day by day and not thinking too far into the future. Because if there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve learned from this, it\u2019s that you never know.\u201d \u2022The 15:17 to Paris is released on 8 February in Australia, and 9 February in the UK and US", "title": "The friends who foiled a gunman - and are now playing themselves in a Clint Eastwood movie"}
