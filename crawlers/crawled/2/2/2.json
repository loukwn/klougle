During Sunday night\u2019s Super Bowl deluge of trailers and adverts, Westworld fans got a chance to see what the second season of the sci-fi western will look like: and it\u2019s not pretty. The trailer for the show, which is set to return in April 2018, sees Evan Rachel Wood\u2019s Dolores deliver a haunting monologue over a subdued piano cover of Kanye West\u2019s Runaway. \u201cWe built this world together, this world where dreams come true,\u201d she says.  \u201cWe can burn it to the ground. From the ashes, build a new world. Our world.\u201d The first season, which finished in late 2016, ended with the robotic hosts of Westworld turning on their human enemies and taking revenge by gunning them down in the twisted theme park. The trailer continues that with Dolores and friends hunting humans on horse back, and seemingly venturing into the real world while threatening to destroy it. There\u2019s been speculation about the different worlds that the second Westworld could explore. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of the origin of a new species on this planet,\u201d said creator Jonathan Nolan.  \u201cAnd being able to tell that in chapters and commit to aggressive moves season-by-season that propel that story upwards and outwards and inwards.\u201d In this trailer there are Native American hosts, the mysterious hooded men from the first season and some non-human-like robots. But there was no sign of the fan favourite Samurai hosts, who appeared in the final scenes of the first series. Westworld\u2019s first season led the Emmy nominations this year with 22 nods, and the first outing saw fans take to sites such as Reddit to air their theories \u2013 many of which were correct. The trailer ends with the US air date of the show: 22 April. The show will start in the UK on Sky Atlantic and Now TV on 23 April.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/05/westworld-season-two-trailer-hbo-we-can-burn-it-to-the-ground", "title": "Westworld season two trailer \u2013 'We can burn it to the ground'"}
