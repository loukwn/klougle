The punchline? That depends on which part of the country you\u2019re in. We\u2019ve long been making gags about our neighbours. The English joke about the Irish, southerners make fun of the north, Liverpudlians tease Mancunians. And vice versa. A comedian can go on stage at a comedy club anywhere in Britain and call a nearby town a dump, and that\u2019s the audience won over. But what about the crowds themselves? Do some jokes go down better in the Midlands than the Highlands? Is there such a thing as a regional sense of humour?  Comic Jayde Adams is from Bristol, and she\u2019s a firm believer that the West Country \u2013 and her city in particular \u2013 has a distinctive sense of humour. \u201cBristolians have a keep-calm-and-carry-on attitude to life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re positive and upbeat. We try to find the funny in most situations, mainly because we\u2019ve got a ridiculous accent. Even if we\u2019re not trying to be funny, we sound funny.\u201d The Bristol accent has been an effective weapon in Adams\u2019s comedy arsenal. Not only because it makes people laugh, says the Edinburgh comedy award-nominated standup, but because she can use it to wrongfoot an audience. \u201cPeople are bright in Bristol, but we\u2019ve got the accent of people who probably aren\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cAudiences think you\u2019re going to be thick, so no one expects me to sing opera at them. It\u2019s fun to play with stereotypes in that way. It\u2019s a great accent for comedy.\u201d Accents can play a part in how well a comedian is received across the country, says Adams. Speak with a regional accent, and other regions will respond more positively. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got a middle-class accent \u2013 or you haven\u2019t got an accent \u2013 you\u2019re going to have a much tougher time,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you go round the country with a posh accent and you don\u2019t make excuses for that, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d Ardal O\u2019Hanlon \u2013 from the border town of Carrickmacross in Ireland \u2013 agrees that having a clearly locatable tone can be an advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s quite telling that the really big comedians \u2013 like John Bishop from Liverpool, Kevin Bridges from Glasgow, Peter Kay from Bolton \u2013 stand out with their strong regional accents,\u201d says the Father Ted star. \u201cPeople love authenticity in comedy and, coming from a region, you get a very strong sense of place. They can place you straight away, so they can relax.\u201d O\u2019Hanlon has been gigging across the UK and his home country for decades, but when he started in the early 90s \u2013 co-founding the International Bar in Dublin \u2013 Ireland had no comedy scene. \u201cCarrickmacross always had a border mentality,\u201d he says. \u201cSmuggling would have been a big thing there in the past; there would have been spillover from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. So people kept their mouths shut. They were very reserved, and as a result the humour was very deadpan and straight-faced. When I was growing up, you never knew whether people were being serious or not. There was a lot of nodding and winking.\u201d When O\u2019Hanlon started performing standup he adopteda persona with similar traits: low-key, monotone, never cracking a smile. Head further south in the republic and the sense of humour becomes more garrulous, he says, more stereotypically Irish. But, despite the regional differences, O\u2019Hanlon believes there is a distinctive sense of humour to the country as a whole. \u201cFirst, we speak a different dialect,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnically it\u2019s called Hiberno-English \u2013 it\u2019s very influenced by the old Irish-Gaelic language. Sentence construction is different, vocabulary is different, pronunciation is different. Second, the storytelling tradition is monstrous. The Romans never made it as far as Ireland, the Reformation didn\u2019t take hold in Ireland, we didn\u2019t really have an industrial revolution \u2013 so one of the only forms of entertainment was storytelling. I think that inspired the current generation of Irish comedians.\u201d To the rest of the world, the UK also has a particular comedic reputation. There\u2019s a British sense of humour \u2013 sarcastic and self-deprecating. We love innuendo and satire. But what seem like barely noticeable regional traits to a foreigner seem like huge differences from within the country. \u201cI see certain regions almost like ethnic minorities within Britain,\u201d says Blackburn-born standup Tez Ilyas. \u201cScouse is almost an ethnic minority, as is Geordie, as is Glaswegian, or living in the Welsh valleys. And they all have their own brand of humour that as an outsider you\u2019d struggle with \u2013 in the same way that ethnicities have their own sense of humour as well.\u201d Lancashire is a particularly sarcastic place, says Ilyas, but equally specific is the northern Asian-British sense of humour. \u201cBlackburn\u2019s a highly segregated town and there\u2019s a very clear line between where the Asian people live and where white people live. Because of that, most Asians in Blackburn grew up in quite insular communities, so we only interacted with white people at school or work. We came up with coping mechanisms to deal with talking with the other side, and part of that is the sense of humour.\u201d While these regional shifts might seem alienating to outsiders, to natives there\u2019s a sense of ownership and comfort in being able to laugh at a joke that others can\u2019t latch on to. \u201cTake Four Lions,\u201d says Ilyas. \u201cI enjoy that film on a level that some can\u2019t enjoy it on, because I grew up with people who sound like [protagonists] Waj and Faisal \u2026 There\u2019s something unique about it to me. When I do a home town gig I spend half an hour ripping different parts of the town apart, and it goes down brilliantly. You can only do that if you know a place super well.\u201d With such a sense of locality and ownership across the UK and Ireland \u2013 where every town argues that it has the best sense of humour \u2013 which locations actually make for the best audiences? Bristol is a magical place to gig. They\u2019ll laugh at silly things but, if you get political, they\u2019ll go with that, too \u201cBristol is a magical place to gig,\u201d says Ilyas. \u201cThe people there want to have a really good time. They\u2019ll laugh at things that are stupid or silly, but, if you get political, they\u2019ll go with that, too.\u201d Brighton aside, south coast audiences are the toughest, says Ilyas. Is that because they respond less well to a northern comic? \u201cPossibly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little bit Ukippy, so I think that\u2019s part of it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s a bloody tough gig,\u201d says Adams. \u201cA Wednesday or Thursday night at Soho theatre in London \u2013 you can get some right stinkers there. But it\u2019s difficult all over the place. The less the local area has going on, the more interested they are in the gig.\u201d For O\u2019Hanlon? \u201cWell, I always enjoy the Belfast audience,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always knew that people there were going to be lively and up for it. Partly because of the Troubles, I suppose they always appreciated people who made the effort to go there. Every single audience is different, every single night is different \u2013 and it\u2019s baffling. Sometimes you think, \u2018Yep, I\u2019ve got this absolutely cracked. I know what to expect.\u2019 And then you go out there and it\u2019s entirely different, and you\u2019re wrongfooted from the start. It\u2019s endlessly fascinating. It\u2019s what keeps me in the game.\u201d  \u2022 Jayde Adams is at the Leicester Comedy festival on 11 February and Machynlleth Comedy festival on 4 May. Ardal O\u2019Hanlon stars in Death in Paradise on BBC One. Tez Ilyas is on tour from 27 March.", "title": "'My accent's ridiculous so it's great for comedy': standups on their home town's humour"}
