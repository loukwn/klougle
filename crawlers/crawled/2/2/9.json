Quite where this leaves viewers facing the same programme in an era when the mytharc has become the news cycle, I\u2019m not sure. The 2016 reboot \u2013 the 10th series outing for David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson \u2013 more or less binned the alien colonisation stuff and brought the threat closer to home, giving it heft and resonance while still having room for fantasy. Most of the criticism it faced centred on its failure to live up to the storytelling prowess of the original rather than for working against the emotional zeitgeist. But as Sam Goldwyn so rightly said, we\u2019ve all passed a lot of water since then. Especially the president of the United States, if the rumoured tapes don\u2019t lie. That said, as the opening episode of series 11 unfolded last night, it was the storytelling that failed first. At the end of series 10, there was a global contagion, Mulder was dying, Scully was about to hare off to find son William and harvest his stem cells to save him and possibly humanity, and the dead-since-season-nine-16-years-ago Cigarette Smoking Man had emerged to act everyone else off the screen even in plague prosthetics. At the beginning of last night\u2019s instalment \u2013 do I really have to say \u201cspoiler alert\u201d? OK, SPOILER ALERT \u2013 Carter pulled a Dallas. It was basically all a Scullydream, except for the bits that weren\u2019t. Honestly. People try my patience sometimes, they really do. So. Seer Scully hath only foretold ye global contagion and reckoneth that William be sending her vision-prophecies (a neurological scan while she lies comatose in hospital reveals her hypothalamus is pulsing in such a way that it signals \u201cFind him\u201d in morse code. I know, I know) so that his parents will seek him out and use him to thwart the Smoking Man\u2019s ungodly plans. The Smoking Man is real, you see. Alive again, he plans to rid the world of the scourge of humanity because \u2013 oh, I don\u2019t know. Because he\u2019s evil? Knackered? Despairs, like the rest of us, of ever properly grasping his plot line again? Or simply tired of delivering portentous monologues in voiceover when he should be giving us his Lear at the Guthrie? He wants to find William, too, for ... reasons. There\u2019s a reveal at the very end that, if you squint hard and look with all the goodness that is in your heart, might qualify as a twist rather than just Another Goddamn Rug-Pulling, but other than that there is an overwhelming sense that the creator and his writers are just howling into the void of their own making. But \u2013 especially for those who remember the 90s incarnation in unstreamed form \u2013 context is all. Now, when Mulder expounds a theory, or \u201cproof\u201d that the moon landings were staged is offered up, you cower at the thought of the internet eccentrics adding another brick to their bunkers of certainty. Current real-life events and people make you sympathise with the Smoking Man, who looks increasingly like a\u00a0model of probity. \u201cFair enough,\u201d you think. \u201cWe had our chance. Look what happened. I couldn\u2019t come up with five good reasons right now why you shouldn\u2019t unleash every plague you reverse-engineered at Roswell thrice over. I have a sneaking suspicion that Duchovny will thank you, too, even if his agent won\u2019t.\u201d Reports from the US assure viewers that there are solid monster-of-the-week-type episodes coming up. I hope so. I am sore in need of comfort and escape. I\u00a0cannot have all my art reflecting life. I would like to see the hand of a\u00a0benevolent creator intervening to tidy up the sprawling madness, impose order and propel us all towards a happy ending. I want to believe, if\u00a0not in God, then at least in the power of television.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/05/the-x-files-review-mulder-and-scully-juddering-reboot-jumps-the-shark", "title": "The X-Files review \u2013 juddering Mulder and Scully reboot jumps the shark"}
