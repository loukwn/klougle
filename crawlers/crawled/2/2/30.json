As he reeled off hits and stunning guitar solos, the dancers and special effects seemed almost beside the point: there was something thrillingly defiant and pugilistic about his performance, a man who knew he could do it all better than anyone else, imperiously showing them how it\u2019s done. For any other artist, a torrential storm during half-time would have been a disaster: for Prince, singing Purple Rain in the middle of the downpour, it was a final, magical addition to the show.  You might have thought Beyonc\u00e9 was the 2016 Super Bowl headliner \u2013 rather than a guest in a show dominated by Coldplay \u2013 so effortlessly was the show (and subsequent headlines) stolen by her ferocious performance of Formation. Black Panther-adjacent uniforms and all, it repurposed a beloved American showbusiness institution as an act of political protest. A year after Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga\u2019s performance mixed hits, spectacle \u2013 it began on the roof of Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium \u2013 and purpose. In the wake of Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, she sang Woody Guthrie\u2019s This Land Is Your Land and performed LGBTQ anthem Born This Way: the first time the word \u201ctransgender\u201d had been heard during a Super Bowl show. It looks almost low-key by today\u2019s standards, but Jackson\u2019s performance \u2013 stunning choreography, hit after hit crammed into 12 minutes \u2013 drew 90 milion viewers and changed half-time at the Super Bowl for ever. Previously the domain of Elvis impersonators, marching bands and Disney Mouseketeers, it became a storefront for pop\u2019s biggest stars, with increasingly edgy results.  Springsteen had previously repeatedly turned down requests to perform at the Super Bowl, perhaps understanding that glitzy, spectacular pop is more suited to the occasion than rock. But his no-frills show, replete with a charged, if shortened, Born to Run, was pretty triumphant, and testament to his endless experience in creating intimacy in vast venues.  So wilfully ridiculous and OTT that an appearance by a shirtless Lenny Kravitz counted as momentarily dialling it down a bit, Perry\u2019s show featured dancing beach balls and palm trees, a giant robot tiger, the entire world\u2019s supply of pyrotechnics and that infamously uncoordinated carcharodon, Left Shark. Musical highlight, by some distance: a guest spot from Missy Elliot.  The shadow of 9/11 hung heavy over the 2002 Super Bowl show, with the names of the dead projected on a vast, unfurling screen as U2 performed Where the Streets Have No Name. Wisely, the band avoided doing anything other than playing: no sermonising from a frontman frequently given to doing so. Instead, an intense, cathartic version of Beautiful Day.  Everything Jackson and Timberlake did onstage was overshadowed by the appearance \u2013 unscheduled or otherwise \u2013 of one of the former\u2019s breasts. The furore provoked a Mary Whitehouse-esque campaign to clean up American entertainment, during which a DJ called Bubba the Love Sponge lost his job. This was presumably not the performance\u2019s intended effect. Madonna\u2019s half-time show had its highlights \u2013 her performances of Vogue and Express Yourself; the appearance of Nicki Minaj; MIA giving a cameraman the finger \u2013 but it was hobbled by her desire to remain contemporary: you really did get an awful lot of fleetingly popular pop-rap berks LMFAO for your buck. Finally, for the purposes of comparison, a taste of what a Super Bowl show was like before rock and pop took over: the University of Texas\u2019s band played patriotic songs, the Westchester High School Wranglerettes did their thing, and the star turn was Miss Texas 1973, Judy Mallett, displaying her talents on the fiddle. It was 1974. It might as well have been 1934. ", "title": "The 10 greatest Super Bowl half-time shows -\u00a0Ranked!"}
