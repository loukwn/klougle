There has been some progress this year with notable nominations for female-driven movies and black film-makers. Bailey prefaced his remarks by noting that he is a \u201c75-year-old white man\u201d, later adding: \u201cThe Academy is at a crossroads of change \u2026 We are witnessing this motion picture academy reinvent itself in front of our very eyes, and a greater awareness and responsibility in balancing gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.\u201d Introducing the newest class of #Oscars nominees! pic.twitter.com/eTn4HpoaIl Outside the luncheon, Latino film-makers and the National Hispanic Media Coalition staged a protest calling for increased representation. Despite diversity gains in this year\u2019s awards season, Latinos continue to be massively underrepresented, occupying only 3% of speaking characters in 2016\u2019s top 100 films, according to one study. Some launched a #LatinosLeftOut hashtag this year, building on the #OscarsSoWhite movement. Last year\u2019s Oscars luncheon was colored by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, which affected some film-makers from Muslim-majority countries, including an Iranian director nominated for best foreign film.  \u201cEach and every one of us knows that there are some empty chairs in this room which has made Academy artists [into] activists,\u201d Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the previous president, said in her speech last year. \u201cThere is a struggle globally today over artistic freedom that feels more urgent than at any time since the 1950s.\u201d In the face of backlash in 2016, the Oscars vowed to double the number of women and minorities in the Academy by 2020.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/05/oscars-president-hollywood-crossroads-me-too-weinstein-diversity", "title": "Hollywood at a crossroad after #MeToo, says Academy president"}
