Before Wakanda, there was Zamunda, where giraffes and elephants roam the palace gardens, the king wears a dead lion around his shoulders, and handmaidens strew the royals\u2019 paths with rose petals and attend the prince\u2019s every need, including the washing of \u201cthe royal penis\u201d. The movie is, of course, Eddie Murphy\u2019s 1988 smash hit Coming to America, whose compendium of cliches showed just how large the gap could be between \u201cAfrican\u201d and \u201cAmerican\u201d, and how much work Black Panther has to do. As novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie put it: \u201cIf all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and Aids, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.\u201d What could have given her that impression? Surely not movies such as Blood Diamond, The Constant Gardener, Hotel Rwanda, Beasts of No Nation, Tears of the Sun, Out of Africa, Born Free, Gorillas in the Mist, or a few dozen Tarzan movies? Not to mention a canon of pop songs sentimentally blessing the rains down in Africa and questioning whether they know it\u2019s Christmas time at all? And that\u2019s just white popular culture. As Coming to America suggests, African Americans are likely to have their own, more complicated set of assumptions about Africa, most likely received from Hollywood movies rather than direct experience. That was certainly the case with Murphy. Coming to America\u2019s Africa is a place of feudal hierarchy, pre-feminist sexual politics and arranged marriage. \u201cI want a woman that\u2019s going to rouse my intellect as well as my loins,\u201d says Akeem, in Murphy\u2019s cod-African accent. As if the only way to find one of those is to look beyond the continent. Coming to America at least laughs at African Americans\u2019 ignorance, too. \u201cWearing clothes must be a new experience for you,\u201d one black American character tells Akeem, before asking if he played \u201cchase the monkey\u201d back in Africa. Murphy had already given viewers a stereotypical language-mangling, beef jerky-chewing \u201cCameroonian\u201d in 1983\u2019s Trading Places. Even worse was his 1987 standup film Raw, in which he jokes about going to Africa to find a wife: \u201cSome crazy, naked zebra bitch \u2026 with a big bone in her nose and a big plate lip and a big fucked-up Afro.\u201d But he worries that his \u201cbush bitch\u201d would become Americanised and demand half his money. Murphy was apparently saddened at criticisms that Coming to America stereotyped Africans, says Tejumola Olaniyan, professor of African diaspora cultural studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has written on how the movie \u201cothers\u201d Africa. \u201cIt was actually meant to be a positive portrayal of Africa: they are rich Africans, not poor. They are noble, they are humble. He wanted to overturn Hollywood\u2019s images. It was still a kind of romanticisation but the movie only happened at all because of Murphy\u2019s power in Hollywood.\u201d Olaniyan sees Coming to America as a turning point for portrayals of Africans in pop culture. Comedy Africans still popped up but they were generally benign, such as Dinka, the naive, portly, generally decent Nigerian in Ice Cube\u2019s Barbershop series. Just as the locals in Coming to America\u2019s barbershop called Akeem \u201cKunta Kinte\u201d (a reference to the slave hero of Roots), so Dinka is called \u201cMandingo\u201d, \u201cShaka Zulu\u201d and \u201cSuper-size me Mandela\u201d. \u201cWhere I come from, to have girth is a sign of opulence,\u201d Dinka says. Rather than suggesting black Americans are just as racist as white ones, these attitudes could be seen as \u201ca direct by-product of the colonialism that removed black people from Africa in the first place,\u201d argues Tyree Boyd-Pates, a Los Angeles-based professor and writer on African-American culture. \u201cOftentimes, you use the same lens as the colonising group you have been underneath. African Americans in particular will often relegate the 54 countries of Africa to one country, and will often look at it through the prism of America, and end up perpetuating the same negative perceptions of Africa, even though they come from there.\u201d Being black in America comes with its own long history of prejudice and stereotyping, much of it shared with Africans on the continent. But there is another aspect to the relationship: for black Americans, Africa is also the motherland, spiritually as well as ancestrally. In the modern era, a reconnection began in the civil rights era, which intersected with the growing pan-African movement. After four trips to Africa between 1959 and 1964, Malcolm X drew connections between racial oppression at home and colonial oppression in Africa. Less than a year before his death he founded the Organisation of Afro-American Unity. There was also Muhammad Ali, who visited Ghana, Nigeria and Egypt in 1964, and found it nothing like Hollywood. \u201cThey never told us about your beautiful flowers, magnificent hotels, beautiful houses, beaches, great hospitals, schools and universities,\u201d he told reporters. Ali\u2019s huge 1974 fight The Rumble in the Jungle was an unprecedented trans-continental event, bringing to President Mobutu\u2019s Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), not only US TV cameras but also music stars, including James Brown, Bill Withers and BB King. \u201cAfrica\u2019s my home \u2013 damn America and what America thinks!\u201d says Ali in the documentary When We Were Kings. \u201cYeah, I live in America, but Africa\u2019s the home of the black man, and I was a slave 400 years ago, and I\u2019m going back home to fight among my brothers.\u201d Maybe more than movies, it was music that opened the channels of American Afrocentrism, from jazz, soul and funk to early hip-hop. The latter might have looked very different had a Bronx kid not won a trip to Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau in an essay-writing competition in 1974, and re-christened himself Afrika Bambaataa. Between Bambaataa\u2019s Zulu Nation and the Native Tongues movement of De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers and Queen Latifah, hip-hop headed down a peace-loving, socially conscious path in the late 1980s and early 90s, accessorised with Africa-shaped leather pendants, dashikis, kufis, headscarves and red, black and green graphics. That Afrocentric strand has continued through hip-hop but the chasm between the cultures still occasionally yawns open. In a press conference in 2012, for example, Nas explained why hip-hop artists don\u2019t perform in Africa much. \u201cPeople are scared. There\u2019s horror stories about Africa that is out of this world \u2026 Some of those Africans need to make an effort to show us that it\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d he said. A few years earlier, he had eulogised \u201cthe black oasis, ancient Africa the sacred\u201d, in his lyrics. Conversely, Boyd-Pates notes that African stereotypes of black Americans \u2013 moneyed, thuggish, hypersexualised, fond of using the N-word \u2013 are primarily gleaned from R&B videos. But rap and R&B are now reconnecting with Africa on a meaningful level, looking at artists such as Solange, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, and most of all Kendrick Lamar, whose 2014 visit to South Africa inspired his album To Pimp a Butterfly. Echoing Ali, Lamar said: \u201cI felt like I belonged in Africa. I saw all the things that I wasn\u2019t taught. Probably one of the hardest things to do is put [together] a concept on how beautiful a place can be \u2026 I wanted to put that experience in the music.\u201d It is no coincidence that director Ryan Coogler selected Lamar to produce the Black Panther soundtrack. In contrast to \u2013 and possibly in atonement for \u2013 Coming to America, the makers of Black Panther seem determined to get things right, drawing on research trips to Africa, historical resources and specific cultural references. The cast combines African and African-American actors, and the national language of Wakanda is, in fact, Xhosa. We have come a long way since Coming to America, observes Olaniyan. \u201cThere\u2019s been a kind of normalisation of Africa in popular culture in the US,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is the reason why Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018shithole\u2019 comments sounded so out of touch. Americans know more Africans, they see more Africans, they visit Africa more, and there are more qualitative interactions between them.\u201d For many, Black Panther is more than just another blockbuster; it is a cultural moment. Wakanda could be a visualisation of that black utopia pan-Africanists have dreamed of. \u201cBlack Panther is the beautiful aesthetic climax of just that ideology,\u201d says Boyd-Pates. \u201cThat paradigm of black people that exceeds the expectations of white civilisation, that places black people in a place similar in their minds to what they always felt they were robbed of, and connects them back to the motherland in a way no colonial effort could ever undermine.\u201d After centuries of Africa coming to America and vice versa, perhaps we have finally reached the point where they can meet halfway.
