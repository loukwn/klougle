The temperature changed quite suddenly. \u201cIf I can just say,\u201d she began, \u201cas the only representative of the female gender here today \u2013 I know it\u2019s not high-level, but it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018high-level\u2019 for women to feel under siege in somewhere like the House of Commons. Actually, for women, if you\u2019re constantly being harassed, even in a small way, that builds up, and that wears you down.\u201d There was a pause. Then the audience started cheering. Today, Brand, a woman who refuses to be described as a national treasure, preferring \u201cnational disgrace\u201d, says she didn\u2019t plan to say a word. \u201cI\u2019m a real hectorer usually \u2013 it was lucky I didn\u2019t shout, because otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have taken the wind out of everyone\u2019s sails in the same way. It had an impact.\u201d She says this as if it was a surprise but, of course, Brand, now 60, has been making an impact for decades, first with her monotone standup about men and weight (\u201cI read that book Fat Is A Feminist Issue, got a bit desperate halfway through and ate it\u201d) and today for her dry contributions to primetime TV where, as well presenting the sister programme to The Great British Bake Off, she is often the lone woman on a panel of men. She is so famous that a doctor asked for her autograph while she was in labour. I\u00a0think reality TV helped create this nasty edge And quietly, behind the panel shows and programmes about cats, Brand has been creating her own genre of sitcom, one that makes you cry. In an episode of Getting On, her award-winning BBC series set on a hospital ward, Brand (as nurse Kim Wilde) stands by as young doctors are introduced to a homeless patient whose \u201cclothing has fused to the skin\u201d and suffers from a perianal abscess. \u201cGo on, have a root around,\u201d insists the consultant, briskly. Another episode revolved around the hunt for the person who\u2019d pooed on a chair. In its jolly mundanity the programme drew on Brand\u2019s early career as a psychiatric nurse, and read as an unlikely love letter to the NHS. Her new show, Damned (now beginning its second series), has a similar feel, with its palette of mud and beige soundtracked by the endless ringing of phones, but is set in the office of a council\u2019s children\u2019s services department. Damned (as in, \u201cDamned if you do\u2026 \u201d) is similarly respectful of those slogging through bureaucracy and government cuts to help people in need, and similarly happy to chuck a few more poo gags at them, too. Series two begins with Brand\u2019s character hobbling into the office having stepped in a pile of it. There the shitty shoe sits, under her desk, as she squabbles with her fellow social worker Al (played by Alan Davies) who must simultaneously determine whether the children of a sex worker should be taken into care. They try putting the shoe in the freezer; against Al\u2019s recommendation, the kids are taken away. \u201cThere are so many clich\u00e9s about social workers,\u201d Brand explains, \u201cwhen actually they have these horrendous jobs. At a time when things are getting worse, when so many people are in a bad way, and when that inevitably rebounds on to their children, from housing troubles to drug problems to the huge number of men with undiagnosed depression who take it out on their families with violence, I wanted to show that social workers do their best. That they\u2019re human.\u201d Are things getting worse? \u201cOf course they are,\u201d she says, with some weariness. \u201cFood banks exist. We\u2019re seeing new extremes of poverty \u2013 this morning I heard about a woman who could only afford to feed her child, so all she had all day was tea. I mean, choices are made on what the country spends its money on, and I disagree with those choices.\u201d Unexpectedly, she smiles: \u201cBut I sometimes feel like I have to make a case for being allowed to care \u2013 I can practically see that Rees-Mogg person mouthing \u2018champagne socialist\u2019.\u201d That famous cackle. Brand consults a social worker when writing the scripts for Damned, but often they have to water down the horror of his stories; she wants you to have a chuckle while considering human suffering, not hang yourself with the HDMI lead. \u201cThere\u2019s never enough sadness in sitcoms,\u201d Brand says. \u201cWhich is a shame, because we need to laugh as a defence. Being a nurse you become aware of the extremities of human behaviour, and you need a tasteless and appalling sense of humour sometimes. When you see people at their absolute worst, the only thing you can do is joke.\u201d She looks wistful, suddenly, and sits back. \u201cI miss lots about nursing, actually. Mainly the feeling of being tightly connected to a group, because there\u2019s a fair bit of violence on an emergency unit \u2013 I remember machetes, knives, a gun once. So you have to trust everyone completely, which makes for very good friendships. I try to repeat that now by choosing a cast of my mates.\u201d As a nurse, I learned that five times more black people were diagnosed as schizophrenic than white people Alan Davies has known Brand for 30 years \u2013 he\u2019s seen her mature, he says. \u201cBut she\u2019s still very naughty at heart. Her line-learning is hopeless, her continuity all over the shop, her listening is highly selective and she is normally eating sweets at exactly the wrong moment, but all of those cracks and fissures that would get you turfed out of drama school are the things that help her get through long days without feeling too tired and sad to continue.\u201d One of Brand\u2019s small pleasures is an hour on Mumsnet. Partly because of the usernames. \u201cMy favourite is \u2018EatShitDerek\u2019. I\u2019m dying to know the story behind that one.\u201d Partly because she\u2019s a mother, of two teenage girls. And partly because she feels it\u2019s a good reflection of people\u2019s attitudes to controversial topics. \u201cI understand the generational gap in feminist thinking, but the problem comes when the conversations are shut down \u2013 they need to be discussed. As a nurse, for instance, I learned that five times as many black people were diagnosed as schizophrenic than white people, and I wanted to know why. You can\u2019t explore difficult questions without offending some people. So I had to admit I was coming from a point of ignorance, and then start a conversation.\u201d She worries about \u201cno-platforming\u201d. \u201cIf older feminists\u2019 opinions are suppressed, where do we go next? They did a lot of work to move women forward, they can\u2019t be forgotten. But the anger that appears when people do try to talk \u2013 even around something as gentle as Caroline Criado-Perez\u2019s plan to put a woman on the \u00a310 note. She got death and rape threats. Who are these people threatening her, and why are they so angry?\u201d One evening, she was compering an awards ceremony, and a single advertising agency was winning every prize. When they inevitably won the final award, Brand rolled her eyes into the microphone, and tutted: \u201cNot them again.\u201d The crowd laughed, but when the agency\u2019s CEO arrived on stage to receive his trophy, he whispered in her ear: \u201cI always knew you weren\u2019t funny, but I never realised what a cunt you were.\u201d \u201cHe did it to humiliate me, and it worked \u2013 I felt like I was shrinking. But then I took the microphone back and told the audience what he\u2019d said. And I\u2019d never heard 1,500 people gasp before. These bullies are lurking around every corner, but it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re anonymous online \u2013 at least in print you know where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d When Brand started doing comedy in the 80s, under the stage name The Sea Monster, she became used to sneery hecklers and angry reviews. \u201cIn fact, I found it hilarious to stand outside myself, and really see how the press saw me. It was slightly pantomimey, that man-hating lesbian thing, but it was mischievous, and the commentary didn\u2019t always feel abusive.\u201d While she believes it\u2019s easier to be a female comic today than it was 30 years ago \u2013 there\u2019s the choice now, she says, to be subtle, to not have to shout over all the blokes \u2013 the culture around the jokes is less welcoming. \u201cWe\u2019re a crueller society than we were before. I think reality TV helped create this nasty edge, encouraging a Roman colosseum-style judgment.\u201d She smiles almost nostalgically at the good old days, when all the rotten remarks about her talent and appearance would come with a byline. That issue of anonymity, of facelessness compared with openness and robust debate, is one Brand returns to a lot. Often, too, she\u2019s shockingly generous. Where one might expect her to be a bit ranty, she\u2019ll surprise you with quiet thoughtfulness. Perhaps it\u2019s her tired wisdom, perhaps it\u2019s that the Brand we see on telly is still \u201cslightly pantomimey\u201d, but she balances every thought with a care that, in a time of noisy opinion seems almost\u2026 radical. Does anything still make her angry? She considers it carefully. \u201cOne thing that does drive me mad is when women are called \u2018ladies\u2019. It implies a feminine subservience, an obsession with appearance, a waiting to be manoeuvred, a weakness, a quietness. I\u2019ve had to stop myself from shouting, \u2018It\u2019s WOMEN!\u2019 many times. It matters to me!\u201d Apart from that, her life, one where her job regularly involves sitting next to a Jeremy Clarkson or Quentin Letts, is full of moments where she chooses to give rightwing men a chance. \u201cPanel shows are not the forum for saying: \u2018I hate these people\u2019s values.\u2019 In the long run, more hatred is not a good thing. And I don\u2019t necessarily hate these men. I can\u2019t, I\u2019d spend my whole working life angry.\u201d I'm too knackered to be prime minister. Sorry Though Ian Hislop has some quiet reservations about the editing of that Have I Got News For You moment, commenting on it for the first time, he says he\u2019d been responding to a couple of different questions about the Westminster sexual harassment dossier, \u201cNeither of which were about sexual harassment. I felt slightly miffed at how the story was misrepresented.\u201d He, like many, is a huge fan of Brand\u2019s. \u201cWhat she said was eloquent and measured, and struck a chord. It was terrific.\u201d He refuses to confirm a rumour he\u2019s agreed to a pay cut for Have I Got News For You in moves for the BBC to try to close the gender gap, instead choosing to focus on Brand. \u201cI do look forward to her hosting. I tease her that when we first met she was this radical feminist Sea Monster, and now she\u2019s the country\u2019s sweetheart, who goes on TV to talk about cakes. And through it all she\u2019s retained a sense of who she is and what she believes in.\u201d When John Humphrys\u2019 conversation with Jon Sopel was leaked, and they appeared to joke about the BBC\u2019s pay gap row, Brand \u201cenjoyed that window into John Humphrys\u2019 mind. Though we all take the piss when we think we\u2019re safe. But it does show what they really think about the pay gap \u2013 that they don\u2019t take it seriously. It pisses women off when we feel a genuine cause for anger, and are unsupported by men. Whether it\u2019s something like the pay gap, or someone shouting, \u2018Great knockers!\u2019 at a woman in the pub, it\u2019s really common that men will just look away. Things are only going to change when the majority of men step up and support women.\u201d She understands, though, the inclination to stay quiet today, whether about the pay gap or harassment in the film industry. \u201cI presume more people didn\u2019t speak up because they felt ashamed. And now there\u2019s this judgment about how early they spoke up, whether it was after other women had done the hard work, whether they simply turned up in a black dress. This question of guilt, of who\u2019s more guilty than the others. But if there\u2019s not a supportive network then, of course, people aren\u2019t going to risk their careers, their families.\u201d So often, she points out, people are made to choose between \u201chaving principles or earning a living\u201d. When she was eight her headmaster in Kent explained politics to them. Conservatives, he said, want to keep everything the same, and Labour want everything to change. When she repeated this at home her parents corrected her, and it seems she\u2019s been engaged ever since. Her mother, now in her 80s, is a social worker. There\u2019s a YouTube clip of her being kicked out of a council meeting in Ludlow. \u201cA minute later she returns, having forgotten her handbag, then on her way out she grabs the microphone and starts shouting into it.\u201d Brand tells the story with pride \u2013 the genes are strong. Is she positive about the future? \u201cWell, society goes in cycles, politics goes from left to right then back again, comedy goes from leftwing humour in the 80s to tax-dodging comics in the 90s, so I\u2019m sure everything will turn again soon. Billy Connolly used to say: \u2018The desire to be a politician should bar you for life from ever becoming one.\u2019 People who go out to seek power are scary people.\u201d Does that mean Brand has no plans to stand for the Labour party? Her fans will be disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long time doing things other people want me to do. Now I\u2019m going to be selfish. All I want to do is read and walk. Besides, I\u2019m too knackered to be prime minister.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cSorry.\u201d Damned returns to Channel 4 this month", "title": "Jo Brand: \u2018Bullies are lurking around every corner'"}
