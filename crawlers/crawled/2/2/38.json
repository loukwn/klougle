This play by Conor McPherson (The Weir) takes the form of three duologues in which Dublin undertaker John, a man who has given it all up in favour of the bottle, must decide on Christmas Eve in a rundown office whether he wants to start a new life. The dusty Christmas fairy lights wink at him in doleful reproach.  This is a play haunted by regret and mired in quiet despair. John has been saved once before by an act of kindness from his employer who now lies dying in the hospital. Then Mary (Siwan Morris), the daughter he hasn\u2019t seen for 10 years, arrives with news of his ex-wife\u2019s terminal cancer. Will it be a spur to salvation?  McPherson\u2019s play had a muted response when it reopened the refurbished Royal Court in London in 2000, largely because it wasn\u2019t The Weir 2. But the play has its own understated richness as, in a series of near-monologues, John (subtly played by Simon Wolfe) recounts how he poured his life away. It\u2019s a devastating portrait of loneliness delivered in prose that glimmers and glows.  It\u2019s in a minor key, but Matthew Xia\u2019s production grips even if it over-eggs key moments with falling leaves, a rising hum and the sudden appearance of a wreath, suspended over the stage, representing endurance and salvation. All this play requires is crystalline, unsentimental performances to match its sorrowful, redemptive tenderness. \u2022 At the Sherman, Cardiff, until 17 February. Box office: 029 2064 6900.
