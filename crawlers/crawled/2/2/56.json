The camera captures Warhol\u2019s awkwardness and Vreeland\u2019s monumental self-possession, her fanatical attention to detail. Is she blotting her foundation? Correcting the slashes of blusher she wore on forehead, cheekbones and earlobes? They both loved makeup. For that matter, they\u2019d both made themselves up, twin miracles of self-invention, New York\u2019s reigning arbiters of beauty, celebrity, success and fame. Both were from immigrant families, albeit from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Warhol\u2019s father was a coal miner, Vreeland\u2019s mother a socialite. What they shared was the certainty of their own hideousness, their abject failure to be attractive. Vreeland\u2019s stunning mother nicknamed Diana \u201cher little monster\u201d. In an interview given the year after Leibovitz\u2019s photograph was taken, Diana said that as a child she believed herself \u201cthe most hideous thing in the world\u201d. The same was true of balding, bulbous-nosed, spotty Andy. They\u2019d triumphed by sheer will, reducing themselves to elegant cartoons: Andy pancake-pale in his wig and Brooks Brothers suit, Diana trimmed in scarlet, her hair an unnatural black cap. Vreeland appears on 63 pages of Warhol\u2019s diaries. At first, she was a good companion, a source of gossip. He borrowed her words \u2013 shockeroo \u2013 and attended her parties. Later, she became a watchword for imperious behaviour. Even in their honeymoon period, she wasn\u2019t afraid of bullying Andy. On 15 February 1978, she hit him at dinner (\u201cshe really hurts\u201d) and screamed: \u201cYou should know better than to open your mouth!\u201d, then excused herself by saying she couldn\u2019t stand being around old people, including herself. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s just happened here. It would explain the stilted mood. Even the painted roses on the wall look natural compared to these two great paragons of artifice. \u2022 Annie Leibovitz: The Early Years, 1970\u20131983 is published by Taschen (\u00a340).
