Much as I enjoy the odd fright night, there is no genre to which I subscribe quite so literally. But with the nights drawing in and the burning scent of Halloween on the cooling breeze, it seemed an apt time to return. We\u2019re never likelier to chain-watch horror films than in October, and Shudder certainly makes a breeze out of spooky seasonal playlisting. I returned to find it a little beefier than I remembered, with its menu of films and series healthily expanded and the addition of Shudder TV \u2013 multiple channels of pre-selected programming for that rarest of geeks, the undiscriminating genre obsessive. I sampled the free-to-stream channel, which can be watched by non-subscribers, to find Shrew\u2019s Nest playing. Juan Fernando Andr\u00e9s and Esteban Roel\u2019s enjoyably ripe Spanish gothic piece is a lively choice, and there\u2019s no arguing with the value, though I suspect most horrorheads would rather pick their tasty poison. The selection, after all, is more diverse than you might expect, covering the art-trash spectrum rather nicely. Traditionalists of varying gore capacities can access Tobe Hooper\u2019s original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its slick 40th-anniversary restoration, Mario Bava\u2019s sticky-stylish giallo classic Blood and Black Lace or, more cosily, Ealing Studios\u2019 elegantly shivery anthology Dead of Night. More modern tastes predominate, particularly when it comes to the service\u2019s sidebar of exclusive acquisitions. Here\u2019s the place to find, if you dare, Emiliano Rocha Minter\u2019s We Are the Flesh, a stunningly extreme incest-and-cannibalism exercise; Lake Bodom, a smart, self-reflexive Finnish spin on the old-school slasher flick that doesn\u2019t forget to tuck a few good sharp scares in amid the winks; or Anna Biller\u2019s gorgeously retro-styled occult fantasia The Love Witch. Shudder\u2019s genre remit is pleasingly catholic: arthouse titles such as Lucile Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107\u2019s head-scrambling, nightmare-igniting vision Evolution, or Mother, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s thrillingly derailed blend of icy noir and high melodrama, aren\u2019t obvious Halloween-marathon fodder, but they\u2019ll leave your nerves suitably disarranged. And on the series side, a month\u2019s subscription is worth it if only to belatedly discover, as I did, Beyond the Walls, a delicious French-Belgian miniseries that takes an old-as-the-hills haunted-house premise and probes every cobwebbed corner of it. Led with steely conviction by the excellent Veerle Baetens and ravishingly designed throughout, it\u2019s a treat for those who prefer a mounting wall of eeriness to violently bone-crunching terror. If you\u2019re in the mood for chills but daunted by that degree of choice, meanwhile, the good curators of Mubi have also got in on the October act. Their Halloween season begins today with It Follows, David Robert Mitchell\u2019s buzzingly atmospheric indie humdinger from 2014 which mixes its jolts with fascinating psychosexual politics. Others to come ahead of All Hallows Eve include Hammer Horror\u2019s gleefully lurid keystone film The Curse of Frankenstein; Jim Mickle\u2019s surprisingly smashing US remake of the Mexican cannibal family tale We Are What We Are; George A Romero\u2019s widely misidentified feminist-era curio Season of the Witch; and of course, Jennifer Kent\u2019s still extraordinary The Babadook, a visceral plunge into maternal torment that perhaps already merits reappraisal after inadvertently becoming an internet meme machine. Now\u2019s the month to meet it on its original, terrifying terms. Night of the Demon (Powerhouse Films, PG)Sticking with the Halloween theme, this is the first Blu-ray release of Jacques Tourneur\u2019s indelible 1957 satanic-cult thriller, in a bells-and-whistles package on the Indicator label. McQueen (Lionsgate, 15) This docu-biography of the late fashion genius Alexander McQueen could have been a cheaply morbid slab of celebrity worship, but sublimely avoids every pitfall. Informative and heart-snapping, it\u2019s also a luscious ode to his aesthetic. The Bookshop (Universal, PG) The sly social satire of Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s novel gets unfortunate large-print treatment in Spanish director Isabel Coixet\u2019s earnest but ersatz-feeling adaptation, starring Emily Mortimer as a bookshop owner under fire in a conservative-minded village. Distant Voices, Still Lives (BFI, 15)On its 30th anniversary, Terence Davies\u2019s fragile-hearted Liverpool memory pieces gets a 4K restoration that luckily leaves its scratchy textural beauties intact.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/22/streaming-the-best-horror-films-shuddder-mubi"}
