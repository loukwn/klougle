Smith is now an insistently transatlantic writer, dividing her life between New York and Queens Park in London. These pieces were written during the eight years of the Obama administration, and therefore largely in the time \u2013 which, alarmingly, starts to look like a relatively rational period \u2013 of coalition government in the UK. There is only one mention of Donald Trump in the book; Theresa May does not get a look in. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, has a walk-on as a politician who still looks more a dead-end past than a born-again future, someone who has \u201cprofoundly betrayed the youth vote\u2026 [and] must go\u201d. Written before Trump\u2026 these essays are missives from a gentler, more hopeful age This sense of prelapsarian history does not necessarily hobble Smith\u2019s compendious musings \u2013 a brick of an essay collection like this one is the acknowledgment of a certain status in a novelist, something like a \u201cmajor retrospective\u201d for a painter \u2013 but it does make several of them read like lively period pieces. Smith\u2019s Brexit Diary, reproduced from the pages of the New York Review of Books, only takes us to the point of Nigel Farage\u2019s triumphant union jack shoes (though, written from her in-laws\u2019 home Ulster, it does contain many prescient lines: \u201cin Northern Ireland it was clear that one thing Brexit certainly wasn\u2019t about, even slightly, was Northern Ireland\u201d and \u201cin Britain Nigels come and go, Ruperts are for ever\u201d). Though they might not have felt such at the time, these are missives from a gentler, more hopeful age. Within them \u2013 as Smith\u2019s enthusiastic attention ranges over subjects as diverse as Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s style and the depiction of corpses in Renaissance paintings and the discomfiting smudging of English seasons one into the other \u2013 there is an additional nostalgia. The\u00a0further Smith\u2019s acclaim as a novelist has taken her from her growing up in Willesden in the 1980s, the more she wants to hold it in mind. That defining multicultural landscape on London\u2019s north circular serves her writing much like the butcher\u2019s shop and the trials of afternoon tea in Leeds serves Alan Bennett. It invites us to share the writers\u2019 belief that nothing much of what has happened since has fundamentally changed them. If in doubt about what she thinks, Smith\u2019s reflex is to return us to the community around the flats and maisonettes in which she once lived, and from which she emerged thanks to a retrospectively benevolent state that gave her NHS glasses and had faith in public libraries and educated her for free and looked after her aged father. Another attraction of this golden time is that hers was the very last generation in human history that grew up with the printed rather than the digital page. Both in practice and in spirit Smith makes a vivid case for the importance of bookish culture, even as she sometimes fears it is a valediction. She is a rigorous and often inspired reader \u2013 writing with equal acuity about, say, Ursula K Le Guin or Hanif Kureishi. The standout essay here is \u201cGeneration Why\u201d (2010), her dismantling of the idea of Facebook and the addictive solipsism it promotes: \u201c500 million sentient people entrapped in the recent careless thoughts of a Harvard sophomore,\u201d she writes. (For 500 million, now read 1 billion.) Strangely perhaps, given Smith\u2019s antipathy to virtual worlds, the reality she tends toward in her nonfiction is generally a mediated one. There is next to nothing in these pages that could be classed as \u201creporting\u201d in the sense of going out into a less friendly corner of the messy walkable world and testing what you think you know against what you find. Smith is not an essayist in the mode of a Joan Didion, someone who likes to pitch up in a place and try to make sense of it. Instead she uses the format to engage in sort of cultural thought experiments from her desk. Some of these essays gesture toward the voice that Geoff Dyer has made his own; her analysis of the kinship between notable dancers and the act of writing contains some seductive moves \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s very hard to bring to mind Prince dancing where it is practically impossible to forget Michael Jackson\u201d \u2013 but you wonder whether her heart is completely in it. Likewise, her writing is just about\u00a0sharp enough to have you stick with her through a deconstruction of the self-involvement of Justin Bieber as seen through the lens of the philosopher Martin Buber, but you may not be convinced of the point. That latter essay makes the argument that in our culture of self-advertisement, \u201crecognising the reality of other people \u2013 and having them recognise the reality of you \u2013 is at the heart of the matter\u201d. In one of her pieces here, about her reluctance to use the first-person voice in her novels she writes of her love of a \u201cfiction that faces outward, toward others\u201d. It\u2019s a manifesto that makes you wonder, just from time to time, how her nonfiction would sound if she put her supple gifts of description and analysis to work more often in places other than galleries and libraries. \u2022\u00a0Feel Free by Zadie Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (\u00a320).
