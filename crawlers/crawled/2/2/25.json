Her notable works include the 1981 single O Superman and the 2015 film Heart of a Dog, dedicated to her her husband, Lou Reed. Last week she organised Art Action Day, an event in New York promoting open cultural borders. Her album with Kronos Quartet, Landfall, is released on Nonesuch on 16 February, and her book of essays, All the Things I Lost in the Flood (Skira Rizzoli, \u00a360), is out on 6 February.  This is on my beat between the studio and my house. It\u2019s super cosy: a lot of the tables are communal, and they have menus in the back of their chairs, which they got from a chapel. The best food they do is something called strip steak, which is basically a burger, but one of the best burgers I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve also had some of the best conversations of the last year there: the place, the wood, the wine, all put you in a really relaxed and free mood. There are not enough comedies now, so I was relieved to see this. It\u2019s hilarious. It skewers the art world, which is long overdue: that whole scene is pompous and ready for satire. The film looks at what happens when people step out of their social structures in Stockholm, and it makes you realise how isolated people are within their scenes. Elisabeth Moss is fantastic in it. I love Swedish films \u2013 I\u2019ve just been doing some research on my Swedish ancestors so I feel even closer to them. I live in the West Village, which is pretty far away, but I\u2019ve started walking in Central Park a few times a week, early in the morning. It\u2019s kind of changed my life: it\u2019s a huge treasure of a place filled with meadows and forests and lakes and groves. If you go before 9 o\u2019clock, dogs are off the leash and it\u2019s raucous and wonderful. I\u2019ve started having meetings there: because you\u2019re walking you feel that your thinking moves forward as well. Trees do something to people that is deeply magic: you breathe in a different way and everything looks more natural and reasonable. This is on until 11 February, so rush over to Paris to see it. It\u2019s at the Museum of Hunting and Nature, which is a 17th-century house in the Marais district with a collection of all sorts of stuffed animals. There\u2019s a beautiful red gown draped over an animal that I liked very much, and a stuffed cat on an upholstered chair that looks like it\u2019s been strangled. The museum itself should be on everybody\u2019s list as something to see in Paris, and Sophie\u2019s show makes it even more mysterious and beautiful. I love the Quest and I love the chorus in this song: \u201cAll you black folks, you must go, all you Mexicans, you must go.\u201d Their righteous anger is so appealing and it\u2019s got a great beat. It\u2019s one of our great new political songs and it\u2019s a relief to hear somebody saying things so clearly \u2013 I think rap is one of the few art forms that doesn\u2019t ignore the collapse that\u2019s going on. And also any song that rhymes \u201cramen noodle\u201d with \u201csimple voodoo\u201d is good in my book. You\u2019d think that after a lifetime of breathing you\u2019d sort of know how to do it, but not really. This app, made by yoga teacher Eddie Stern, is about how to become balanced and calm. People usually breathe between 15 and 18 times a minute, and this encourages you to breathe at less than half of that, six breaths a minute, which is what meditators and monks do. I think it has a really amazing effect on depression. As our country rips apart, this is one of the things I find really helpful. This is a really phenomenal, interesting moment. What I love about #metoo is that it gives people a way to look at power and men and women in a new way. People are suddenly going \u201clet\u2019s talk about all women, not just the media-friendly movie stars, because all women face this situation\u201d. And of course there\u2019s a backlash, which happened almost immediately. But I love the fact that people are waking up to the situation and thinking about it and seeing their own prejudices in it that they didn\u2019t really see before.", "title": "On my radar: Laurie Anderson\u2019s cultural highlights"}
