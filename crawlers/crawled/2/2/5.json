Caring has called the scintillating 1937 masterpiece he bought for \u00a320-\u00a330m under the title Girl with a Red Beret and Pompom by a new ludicrously self-serving title: Annabel. Fake art history! \u2013 cry the experts. But hang on. Caring is something of a nominalist philosopher, exposing the often arbitrary nature of the names we give art. When Vermeer painted an enigmatic study of a young woman, he did not scribble Girl with a Pearl Earring on the back. This is just a nickname picked up over centuries. The Laughing Cavalier, The Night Watch, Las Meninas and Et in Arcadia Ego are equally made-up names. It\u2019s only in modern times that artists have bothered to name their works at all. David Hockney\u2019s title A Bigger Splash, for instance, is pure poetry. If an artist gives a work a meaningful title, it should obviously be respected as part of that work. It would be weird if the Tate, which owns A Bigger Splash, renamed it Study of a Swimming Pool With Diver\u2019s Impact. Yet the previous title of the 1937 Picasso that Caring has renamed sounded like a dealer\u2019s attempt to give it a romantic moniker. The real history of this painting \u2013 it is a portrait of Picasso\u2019s lover Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, done in the year he painted Guernica \u2013 is safe from Caring\u2019s apparent ignorance of what he has bought because no artist is better documented. Picasso himself collaborated with the famous Zervos catalogue of his works, and kept his own superb archive, now in the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris. What the owner of Annabel\u2019s has done, with laughable arrogance, is to try to short-circuit the complex, elusive processes by which works of art pick up their nicknames over the centuries. But we should not be so religious about the names we pin on art. They distract us from looking at the image. As acts of idiocy go, this is therefore enlightening. A Picasso by any other name still has wonky eyes and a nose going off for a walk.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2018/feb/05/picassos-annabel-the-rights-and-wrongs-of-renaming-paintings", "title": "Picasso's 'Annabel' \u2013 the rights and wrongs of renaming paintings"}
