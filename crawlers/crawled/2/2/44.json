The pulpy classic, which was made famous by the Arnold Schwarzenegger-led films of the 1980s, is now in development, and follows news that the streaming site is working on a Lord of the Rings series. Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik is involved in the project, as is Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Fargo executive producer Warren Littlefield. The series is the latest attempt to adapt the books, which were first published in magazines in the 1930s. In 1982, John Milius directed the much-loved film adaptation \u2013 which included lines that were inspired by the writing of Friedrich Nietzsche and took ideas from paganism \u2013 and provided a platform for Schwarzenegger to become the biggest action star of the 80s. The 1984 follow-up, Conan the Destroyer, (\u201ca hokey quest movie featuring Arnie alongside Grace Jones and Andre the Giant\u201d) was critically panned and veered away from the edgy elements of the original. On the small screen, there have been two animated TV series and Conan the Adventurer, a short-lived 1997 syndicated action-adventure series. There have also been big-screen revivals, most recently in 2011, when Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa played the titular role in a poorly received reimagining. Howard created the character more than 80 years ago, and in recent years there has been a debate as to whether his wanton sexism and racism is compatible with contemporary culture. Writing about the books in 2010, the Guardian\u2019s Allison Flood said: \u201cVillains are usually dark-skinned \u2026 the darker the eviller. The more lily-white a woman\u2019s skin, the more prized she is.\u201d  She added: \u201cHoward might be a product of his time, but so am I, and it\u2019s impossible to read sentences such as \u2018in this accursed city \u2026 where white, brown, and black folk mingle together to produce hybrids of all unholy hues and breeds \u2013 who can tell who is a man, and who is a demon in disguise?\u2019 without cringing.\u201d A plan to reunite Milius, who John Goodman said inspired the Walter Sobchak character in The Big Lebowski, and Schwarzenegger in a sequel to the 1982 Conan was supposed to materialise in 2014, but has failed to do so.", "title": "Amazon announces Conan the Barbarian TV adaptation"}
