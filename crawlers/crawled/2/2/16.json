Speaking to the BBC, the author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was asked about her views on the #MeToo movement \u2013 having previously caused controversy by writing in January that it was the \u201csymptom of a broken legal system\u201d, and warning that \u201cunderstandable and temporary vigilante justice can morph into a culturally solidified lynch-mob habit\u201d. Atwood told the BBC that changes needed to be made in three areas: \u201cOne of them being courts of law. One of them being large institutions and corporations. And one of them being personal behaviour.\u201d \u201cThere used to be a lot of etiquette books on how to behave,\u201d she said. \u201cThose seem to have gone out of the window. We used to be bombarded with them in the 50s. So where is the Mr Manners? There should be a Mr Manners column \u2013 like \u2018What do you do when ...?\u2019. I think it can help men to understand what may possibly be expected of them in the behaviour department.\u201d Atwood said that these guides could be aimed at \u201cordinary people who think they\u2019re on a date\u201d, but she steered clear of suggesting what they might contain. \u201cI think we should let younger people deal with that. I\u2019m 78.\u201d She went on to describe the #MeToo movement as a \u201csymptom of something being wrong\u201d rather than an end goal, saying that it works \u201cas a tool or as a weapon, under certain circumstances\u201d. Atwood was one of many writers to sign an open letter in 2016 calling for the University of British Columbia to be investigated over its dismissal of professor and author Steven Galloway, after allegations of sexual misconduct. Signing the letter was one of the reasons she has been vilified as a \u201cmisogynistic, rape-enabling Bad Feminist\u201d, she wrote in Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail. Atwood told the BBC that the backlash she experienced was \u201cfairly standard\u201d for \u201canyone who says anything except \u2018I believe anything that a woman says\u2019. But she was clear that \u201cit\u2019s quite dangerous to accord infallibility to any group \u2013 including men, popes and women\u201d.", "title": "Margaret Atwood: modern men need 'etiquette books on how to behave'"}
