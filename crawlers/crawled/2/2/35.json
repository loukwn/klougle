Abandoning his piano and unfolding his long limbs, he\u2019s finishing his first UK show in over a year by standing at the front of the Roundhouse stage. His cracked falsetto sounds relaxed enough, but the physical requirements of being a frontman seem new; his only concession to them is a geriatric shuffle. Tonight is a chance for Blake to test material expected to appear on his fourth album, some of which he has to restart as he falters with his loop pedal. Recalling his dubstep-influenced early EPs, Blake\u2019s voice on new single If the Car Beside You Moves Ahead stutters like a malfunctioning droid \u2013 apparently the result of hours of studio manipulation \u2013 yet he recreates the effect live, leaving the audience perceptibly wowed. It\u2019s uncanny and impressive; a cyborg pop concept warmed by human touch. Blake has always occupied a strangely liminal position between genres. Arriving under the \u201cpost-dubstep\u201d banner, he openly referenced acoustic songwriters such as Joni Mitchell and Feist on his 2011 debut before later collaborating with Bon Iver, Frank Ocean and RZA. His appeal rests on never fitting any particular bracket, and judging by tonight\u2019s show, the new material pushes that restlessness even further. Each freshly unveiled song sounds totally different from the last, and it\u2019s hard to imagine them on the same album. Backed by a band, I Can\u2019t Believe the Way We Flow twists a glowing, Motown-style sample over huge drums, vaguely recalling the early-period chipmunk soul of another Blake fan, Kanye West. Asking for a Friend feels like Blake\u2019s interpretation of classic Philly soul, with a horn phrase looping under silky vocal harmonies. Then there\u2019s the strobe-lit, techno-speed Loathe to Roam, a song about \u201ctelling everyone to fuck off\u201d, an apparent tribute to Suicide\u2019s searing synth-punk. Add these to his solo piano cover of Don McLean\u2019s Vincent and the closing Lul Bye, a stark lullaby written for his insomniac friends, and it\u2019s hard to parse the direction of this new album. However, as he proved on the maximalist sprawl of 2016\u2019s The Colour in Anything, Blake is capable of moving in many directions at once \u2013 even while standing. \u2022 Touring until 1 June.", "title": "James Blake review \u2013 cyborg pop warmed by human touch"}
