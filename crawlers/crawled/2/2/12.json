The parliament of owls, to use the collective noun, will arrive at the end of June and remain for three months, after which the larger ones will be auctioned for charity.  The owls, each uniquely and vibrantly decorated, are inspired by an owl image from the elaborately carved pediment of the Sulis Minerva temple at the city\u2019s Roman baths.  Sulis Minerva was a Roman-British goddess believed to preside over the healing hot springs 2,000 years ago. The owl was one of the symbols of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare. The sculptor Alan Dun started off with the design of the owl from the pediment and simplified it, allowing the artists who will come up with the individual designs free rein.  \u201cIn a way it\u2019s a three-dimensional canvas for the artists,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be mosaics, collages and some will be painted, everything you can imagine. You can never know what people will do. Some will be conventional, some unusual, some bizarre but people seem to embrace it.\u201d It is not the first time in recent years that Bath has dipped into its rich history to find a subject for a public art trail.  A decade ago its streets teemed with statues of pigs in honour of the legendary British founder of Bath, King Bladud (the father of King Lear), who was said to have discovered the benefits of the springs centuries before the arrival of the Romans by observing his hogs happily rolling around in mud heated by the water.  Dun said: \u201cThe first time round we did Bladud\u2019s pigs. Then the Romans turned up with everything they brought with them including their various deities. Minerva was the poster girl for Aquae Sulis \u2013 Bath \u2013 and one of her images was the owl.\u201d Bladud\u2019s pigs, which ranged from a hog decorated in Bath rugby club\u2019s stripes to a pig pilot, Piggles, proved hugely popular.  \u201cI remember wandering around the city centre and there was a buzz of conversation,\u201d said Dun. \u201cPeople were saying: \u2018Have you seen this one or that one?\u2019 It was a very good feeling. If we can engender that community spirit again that will be rather nice.\u201d  The Minerva owls, which will be 1.1 metres tall and will perch on 40cm-high plinths, will be sponsored by businesses and organisations and will be transformed by artists, designers and celebrities.  Smaller 75cm owlets will be available for schools, community groups and charities to sponsor and decorate and will be theirs to keep after the event.  The event organiser, Megan Witty, said: \u201cPeople have been asking us for some time to organise another sculpture trail for the city. Events like this are a fantastic way of shining a spotlight on our region\u2019s creativity and heritage, increasing visitor numbers, bringing colour and fun activities to the streets of Bath, and raising funds for local charities.\u201d ", "title": "Bird Bath: 100 owl sculptures to fill city's streets this summer"}
