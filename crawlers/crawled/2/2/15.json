Age: 89. Appearance: Somewhat two-dimensional. Is that just your opinion? No, absolutely everyone was saying it. And who is absolutely everyone? Everyone who met her at the annual Oscar nominees lunch. I would have thought the guest list at the annual Oscar nominees lunch was traditionally restricted to that year\u2019s Oscar nominees. Agn\u00e8s Varda was among them: the 89-year-old French film-maker received her first nomination, in the best documentary feature category, for her short film Faces Places (Visages Villages), chronicling a road trip she made round France with street artist and co-director JR. Huh. She doesn\u2019t sound that two-dimensional. Forgive me. By \u201ctwo-dimensional\u201d I did not mean shallow or lacking the depth born of considered thought and long experience. What did you mean? I meant no more than a few millimetres thick when viewed side-on. So she\u2019s dangerously thin? To be clear: Varda was unable to attend the Oscar lunch, and sent along several life-size cardboard cutouts of herself instead. Why several? To include a range of varied, photo-friendly poses. Created by her 34-year-old collaborator JR, the cutouts included one with her holding a cat, and one where she appeared to adjust JR\u2019s hat as they stood together. You know what? I like the sound of Agn\u00e8s Varda. Indeed, she was arguably the most popular person at the event, hanging out with Meryl Streep and Greta Gerwig. But 89 is a bit old for your first nomination, isn\u2019t it? Did she come to film-making late? If she wins, Varda will be the oldest Oscar-holder ever (James Ivory, also nominated this year for writing Call Me By Your Name, is eight days younger), but she\u2019s no newcomer. She was a central figure in the French New Wave, alongside Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and made her first feature-length film, La Pointe Courte, in 1955. Perversely, the actual, 3D Agn\u00e8s Varda sounds like the most interesting lunch companion ever. Indeed, among other things, she is said to be one of only six people to attend Jim Morrison\u2019s burial. Do say: \u201cIt was really great to meet you, Agnes! You\u2019re such an amazing listener!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, Ms Varda. Now let\u2019s try one in profile.\u201d", "title": "Flat screen legend: Agn\u00e8s Varda sends cardboard cutout to Oscar nominees lunch"}
