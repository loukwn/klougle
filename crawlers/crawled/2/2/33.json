A great piece of theatre can help a child learn to trust their own instincts: during Seesaw, Wilf becomes a bolder version of himself. Stewart Melton\u2019s play, back at the Unicorn after a run in 2014, is about the give and take of friendship. It\u2019s set in a giant sandpit and sees two kids learn how to share the sand, a seesaw and endless cartons of squash. The play is directed by Sarah Argent (whose production Baby Show is also in rep at the Unicorn) and is \u2013 characteristically for Argent \u2013 perfectly attuned to its audience. The show is aimed at children aged three to six but the tensions between this young boy and girl, and the struggles they face to hold on to their identity but also to let go, is equally pertinent to adults. There\u2019s a gentle earnestness to this production that feels just right. It\u2019s a show that takes play and friendship just as seriously as young children do. Verity Quinn\u2019s set has an abstract and dreamy feel: the sprawling sandpit is overlooked by a huge, draped white sheet, which reflects the undulating colours of the sky. Subtle shifts in mood are written large across the set in sweeping bold colours: a false step here or an angry word there impinges on everything and threatens to ruin the day.  Katherine Carlton and Ben Hadi carefully carve out their roles and don\u2019t settle with simply playing \u201cyoung\u201d. Carlton\u2019s character has properly prickly edges and the faltering confrontations between the boy and girl \u2013 accented by Sam Waddington\u2019s emotional lighting states \u2013 powerfully reflect the extreme highs and lows of young friendship.  The seesaw functions as a neat metaphor, which helps the children think deeply without quite realising it. At one point, Carlton\u2019s girl tries to mount the seesaw on her own. She falls off. Wilf whispers loudly to me: \u201cShe tried to do it by herself!\u201d He gets the message completely and, even better, instinctively trusts his own response.
