An eclectic array of selections posed tricky theoretical questions and interrogated the boundaries between artifice and reality; the late Iranian master Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s Close-Up takes a cerebral approach to the camera\u2019s relationship to its subjects, and the cuckoo surrealism of Being John Malkovich digs deeper into the subconscious rather than film form.  Not every selection relished its own conceptual knottiness. Picks such as A Hard Day\u2019s Night and Wes Craven\u2019s New Nightmare use their well-known cast members to lampoon their own celebrity, undermining their public personae to wonderful comic effect. The less successful instances of this phenomenon tend to come from self-aggrandizing types telling their own stories, such as Private Parts, radio shock-jock Howard Stern\u2019s account of his ascent to stardom. Stern\u2019s vanity is part of what\u2019s made him captivating to listeners for decades, but when channeled into art, it sours instead of piquing fascination. It scarcely seems like coincidence that this series should wind up just as Clint Eastwood\u2019s latest, the ripped-from-the-headlines thriller The 15:17 to Paris, should come to theaters. The ageing master\u2019s new feature dramatizes the events of 21 August 2015, in which a gunman opened fire on a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris. A tragedy turned into an exemplar of heroism when a group of passengers joined forces to incapacitate the shooter before he could take any lives. Three of those passengers \u2013 American servicemen Spencer Stone and Alex Skarlatos, both off-duty during the attack, vacationing with their boyhood friend Anthony Sadler \u2013 attained some measure of star status back home for their courage, and now they\u2019ve hit the uppermost echelon of the fame cycle in the US with starring roles in Eastwood\u2019s film. This is the logical conclusion of a recent trend in Eastwood\u2019s oeuvre towards re-enactment of brave displays in modern history. American Sniper tapped Bradley Cooper to turn army marksman Chris Kyle into a vessel for a battered patriotism. Two years later, Eastwood would reframe the story of Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger\u2019s daring emergency landing in the Hudson river as a clash between the rugged individualist (what is a pilot if not a cowboy of the air?) and the federal pencil-necks who won\u2019t let him do his job. From contemporary biopic to full-scale restaging, Eastwood has inched closer to the v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style he\u2019s now fully embraced with his train-contained thriller.  But there\u2019s a precedent and a uniquely American mentality undergirding what might seem an aesthetic choice. Eastwood\u2019s latest continues an august tradition of servicemen going to Hollywood to portray either themselves or men not too different from themselves. In 1946\u2019s watershed hit The Best Years of Our Lives, second world war veteran Harold Russell portrayed a man who barely gets home from the front in one piece; the character has lost a measure of mental wellness, and like Russell, both of his hands. For a sensitive performance using nothing but his own two hooks, Russell earned an Academy Award that medical bills would later force him to pawn. Sharing in that film\u2019s solemnity and star-spangled pride is 1955\u2019s To Hell and Back, an adaptation of wartime ground trooper Audie Murphy\u2019s autobiography in which he portrayed himself during his campaigns a decade and change earlier. Again, audiences turned out in droves to buoy box-office receipts, and Murphy was able to parlay the role he was literally born to play into a longer career in show business.  But while this particular strain of stunt casting has remained lucrative into the present day, some fundamental elements of the approach have changed. The film that most closely resembles Eastwood\u2019s would have to be 2012\u2019s Act of Valor, a thriller that handles like a video game where the playable avatars just so happen to be platoon-loads of bona fide Navy Seals. The boys in uniform helped push grosses to a princely sum of $81.3m, and yet the film leaves them with a pretty raw deal. To quote the great Roger Ebert: \u201cWe don\u2019t get to know the characters as individuals, they don\u2019t have personality traits, they have no back stories \u2026\u201d Their presence in the film comes off as borderline tokenistic, a gesture of \u201csupport for the troops\u201d, that most misappropriated phrase, that ultimately reveals its own shallowness. Eastwood has more than earned himself the benefit of the doubt, that his choice to tap Stone, Sadler and Skarlatos isn\u2019t cheap posturing to appease the ticket-buyers of middle America. At any rate, he\u2019ll make a bundle, because soldiers on the silver screen steadily sell by tapping into something in the red-blooded American psyche. It is impossible to think about anything without eventually returning to Donald Trump, so why not the parallels in how large segments of the national populace think about professionalism. A real estate magnate without a day of public service in his life stepped directly into the highest office, all because enough people believed that some jobs require only gumption and zero knowhow. That same logic would suggest anyone can star in a multimillion-dollar production; if a rank beginner can run the intricate machine that is America, surely one can play make-believe for the cameras. Who needs hoity-toity actors, anyway?", "title": "You played yourself: when Hollywood picks real-life subjects over actors"}
