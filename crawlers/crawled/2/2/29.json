It\u2019s still heaviest on the letter G, admittedly, but the days of Brokeback Mountain standing alone as the popular byword for gay cinema may be numbered. Still, Francis Lee\u2019s exquisite God\u2019s Own Country (online and DVD: Spirit, 15) must put up with being labelled \u201cthe British Brokeback\u201d. Love stories between young, gruff sheep farmers isolated in remote, wind-whipped hills aren\u2019t a sufficiently well-stocked subgenre to make the comparison resistible. But Lee\u2019s story of a guarded, self-destructive son of the soil gradually finding physical and psychological release in a Romanian migrant worker deserves to be treasured on its own terms. Soaked in the dew and sweat of Lee\u2019s Yorkshire homeland, it\u2019s not just a rare, hopeful, working-class gay romance, but a fortuitously timed rejoinder to the isolationist mentality of Brexit \u2013 a tender, sensual examination of what individuals have to gain by seeing past their own borders. Performed with aching integrity by Josh O\u2019Connor and Alec Secareanu, and shot like an especially storm-hued northern watercolour, it\u2019s both a humble queer landmark and one of this decade\u2019s great directorial debuts. No less revelatory a rising British talent than O\u2019Connor, 21-year-old Harris Dickinson burns through US director Eliza Hittman\u2019s Beach Rats (online and DVD: Peccadillo, 15) like the last lit coal in an ash-filled barbecue \u2013 which I mean as a compliment both to the actor and to the mood of scuzzy, no-way-out anxiety sustained by this tough Brooklyn-bro study. As a brooding, sexually conflicted teen attempting to secretly satisfy his curiosity in the dimmed, nameless world of anonymous gay chatrooms and nervous, no-strings hookups, Dickinson clutches a tangle of inchoate erotic impulses and personal insecurities into one intensely felt, fevered character portrait. It\u2019s a performance, and a film, that leaves us with a blurrier, glitchier picture of millennial coming out than God\u2019s Own Country, though both films present a fraught route to the closet door for those on society\u2019s fringes. Over at the ever-improving BFI Player, meanwhile, an LGBT Best of 2017 collection keeps the gay playlist going nicely. Several of its most exciting selections \u2013 The Ornithologist, A Date for Mad Mary, Taekwondo \u2013 have been profiled in this column before, but they\u2019ve also brought Argentine director Edgardo Castro\u2019s buzzing La Noche (2016) out of the shadows. A sprawling, neon-lit trawl through the underground gay club circuit of Buenos Aires, openly inviting comparisons to the Gaspar No\u00e9 school of provocation, it\u2019s at once tough-minded and giddy on alkyl nitrites. That puts it altogether a world away from the simple, sensitive intimacy of Loev (now streaming on Netflix). Sudhanshu Saria\u2019s gently rambling study of two gay childhood friends reunited in Mumbai reflects on chances missed over the course of their longtime relationship. An effectively bittersweet miniature on its own terms, it also stands as a fascinating milestone of gay representation in Indian cinema. Finally, old-school DVD is your only avenue of access to Heartstone, Icelandic director Gu\u00f0mundur Arnar Gu\u00f0mundsson\u2019s emotionally shivering, ravishingly shot tale of adolescent friendship shifted by one-sided attraction, but it rewards the extra effort. Blade Runner 2049 (Sony, 15) A decades-late sequel to the totemic sci-fi classic sounded a foolhardy prospect on paper, but Denis Villeneuve\u2019s vast, dream-building vision gives the lie to that. Hounds of Love (Arrow, 18) Those with fragile stomachs should steer clear, but Australian director Ben Young\u2019s true-crime serial-killer nightmare is a bloodbath of laser-focused intent and intensity. Something Wild (Criterion, 15) The late and much missed Jonathan Demme\u2019s superbly dotty romantic farce \u2013 like Bringing Up Baby for the coke-crazed 1980s \u2013 gets the high-end Criterion Collection treatment.", "title": "Streaming: God\u2019s Own Country joins the LGBT cinema boom"}
