This year, they are taking a bit more of a risk with Jack Whitehall, whose shtick is basically that he\u2019s posh and a benefactor of nepotism, as if that were somehow unique in British comedy circles. Don\u2019t worry if you miss his opening monologue, though: just imagine a man who sounds as if he\u2019s just been told the ski lift is broken doing a) a joke about how posh and English he is; b) a terrible \u201cstreet\u201d accent where he says \u201cthat\u2019s not me\u201d in response to cultural tropes; c) some kind of thing where he and Big Shaq do a re-versed version of urban parody hit Mans Not Hot, much to the embarrassment of everyone. Ever since the Brits had a run of a couple of years where some mildly naughty things happened \u2013 Jarvis Cocker waving his bum in front of a messianic Michael Jackson, Brandon Block stage-invading and throwing his drink over Ronnie Wood \u2013 the Brits have tried to drum up the sense that anything might happen, as if one of Clean Bandit might stride on stage at any moment and free-bleed on Greg James. But of course it won\u2019t, because in 2018 pop stars are dull and celebrities are deferential. As if to drive this previous point home, the people censoring the Brits, which is broadcast on some kind of tape delay, have become so trigger-happy that any time they hear the faintest mention of an expletive, they have a flappy panic and cut the audio out for about half a minute so the entire show starts to feel like a long-distance Skype call. Sometimes you overbook the lineup and are left with a couple of extra performers who seemed like a good idea at the time but are a bit less exciting now you\u2019ve secured Beyonc\u00e9. The Brits\u2019 answer to this conundrum of politeness has been to pair these acts together and, over the years, we\u2019ve had disastrous performances from Queen and 5ive, Cee Lo Green and Paloma Faith and, let us never forget, Natasha and Daniel Bedingfield\u2019s incestuous cover of Ain\u2019t Nobody. In the modern era, these have been consummated with a rush-released single version of the collaboration, with uniformly terrible artwork presumably made by some poor label intern who isn\u2019t allowed to go to the after-parties. Just look at the one for Florence and Dizzee\u2019s You Got the Dirtee Love, which still makes graphic designers cry to this day. Smith is performing at the awards and, with The Thrill of It All, had the UK\u2019s third best-selling album of last year. However, he failed to pick up a single nomination, leading to tabloid headlines claiming he\u2019d been \u201csnubbed\u201d. Now call me Cindy Cynical, but perhaps because Smith\u2019s album came out in November and is therefore eligible for either this year\u2019s or next year\u2019s awards, the \u201csnub\u201d was actually his label preferring to wait for the 2019 ceremony when he won\u2019t be up against Ed Sheeran in every category. Still, the Brits will probably chuck him the \u201cSpice Girls Outstanding Contribution to Music\u201d award so he doesn\u2019t feel left out. Unlike other awards ceremonies, the Brits really is an excuse for huge stars to get smashed. One year, they stopped letting people drink at the ceremony and there was such outrage that the following year Cat Deeley opened the show straddling a giant bottle of champagne shouting: \u201cThe booze is back!\u201d Ever since, the after-parties have been debauched spectacles where you can see Taylor Swift wiggling on the dancefloor to Frank Ocean, or Ed Sheeran being dragged by security out of trendy burlesque club The Box at 6am looking like Basil Brush had been shot by a dart. It\u2019s always worth listening to the Radio 1 breakfast show the next morning to hear who\u2019s so desperate to chase the after-after party they\u2019ve ended up hanging around the studio.
