Later, I put my thoughts in a strong email to the head of the Arts Council and told him that as he was responsible for his staff; her comments alone should make sure that his soul should lie chained to the bottom of the Red Sea. Is it a case of anti-northern bias?No, no I can\u2019t say that. It might have been a bit of a bias against me. I\u2019m not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. They don\u2019t want to deal with the maverick, the artist. I\u2019ve always been good at money, but, no matter what colour of government, they don\u2019t like the fact that, fiscally, we send about \u00a34-\u00a37 back to the coffers of the chancellor for every \u00a31 given in subsidy. They don\u2019t like that, because we take their money and then we lampoon them. If any other industry was that successful, you think they\u2019d be thrilled. There\u2019s always an attack on the establishment, but you need the establishment to provide that seed corn of state sponsorship. We\u2019ve kept seven theatres around the country afloat by bringing in our productions. Anyway, the decision\u2019s made and I\u2019ve had 25 glorious years. Your new production, The Captive Queen, sounds pretty diverse...It\u2019s a company of 11, with seven British\u00a0Asian actors, two black actresses and two Caucasians, one of whom is me. But that\u2019s an artistic concept. I haven\u2019t done it to tick any box whatsoever. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been brewing for 25 years after Tony Harrison introduced me to the play [John Dryden\u2019s Aureng-zebe], because he knows I love a rhyming couplet. It\u2019s John Dryden\u2019s view of India based on travel writings, but also it contains some mores on who was shagging who in London in 1675. We decided to locate it in the last days of the mills in the north where a lot of the blue-collar population were Asian. So it\u2019s not a documentary, it\u2019s just a snapshot. We\u2019re performing in the indoor Sam Wanamaker theatre, so we\u2019ve brought the mill down to the Globe and ripped out the back and gold that [Dominic] Dromgoole started off with. There\u2019s a strange coincidence in that The Captive Queen was commissioned by director of the Globe, Emma Rice, who is also leaving.Yes there is. But new director Michelle Terry has also invited me back to do The Two Noble Kinsmen. So it\u2019s wonderful to have the two ladies invite me. They\u2019re too intelligent to be rivals, they\u2019re just two very nice people. I don\u2019t\u00a0think I\u2019d have handled [being forced out] in the way that Emma has. She\u2019s been terrific, and Michelle is just grace and wit on legs. Are you proud to be one the pioneers of site-specific theatre?Yes, but also what makes us very happy is Northern Broadsides\u2019 employment record: 16 actors on stage regularly, five crew, on the smallest grant in the middle-scale touring department. When they wanted to be scathing, the Arts Council said: \u201cOh, your show doesn\u2019t look very good\u201d and\u00a0we\u2019d say: \u201cNo, but there\u2019s 16 actors on the bloody stage on the piffling amount you give us.\u201d And obviously our design has improved over the years, but I still put as many actors on the stage as I can afford. But you\u2019ve also risked your health?I can\u2019t blame my health on the theatre. No one can budget against prostate cancer, which I\u2019ve got \u2013 it\u2019s slow, but I\u2019ve got it \u2013 and a heart attack and a stent. You could say it\u2019s years of lifestyle. But it\u2019s not slowed me down. I still have some red wine. What do you think of filmed theatre productions such as National Theatre\u00a0Live?I absolutely loathe the fact that the theatre is put into two dimensions. And of course I would say that because\u00a0I\u2019m not famous enough to be in one. But you can also see it happening in soccer; there\u2019s the elitism. Sooner or later, you can see this land is going to be\u00a0filled with six or seven elite companies all beaming their stuff out. And also all the money goes back, not\u00a0into art, but to those elite buildings\u00a0themselves. You say you were naive in 1992 when you started the company and wouldn\u2019t do it now. Why?Well, you don\u2019t need it now. When we opened, people said: \u201cThis is a great new thing and must be encouraged.\u201d Although there wasn\u2019t a lot of money around, we pushed it through. But now there are other wonderful pop-up companies out there with young ideas.\u00a0I wish more of them were language-based, because I tend to be an old dinosaur. But the creative juices of youngsters\u00a0today \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful. \u2022 The Captive Queen is at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, London, until 4 March", "title": "Barrie Rutter: \u2018I\u2019m not everybody\u2019s cup of tea\u2019"}
