{"title": "Best sailing photographs of 2018: Photographer Ricardo Pinto wins prestigious award for sailing photo - CNN", "description": "", "content": " Pinto beat off competition from over 100 photographers representing 25 nationalities in the ninth running of the annual award with shots from Olympic sailing events, the Volvo Ocean Race, the Extreme Sailing Series and many more.  \"It's a privilege to be able to follow some of the best sailing events in the world and witness such amazing moments,\" said Pinto. \"My goal is to be able to share that with everyone, as if they were right there next to me.\" The annual contest picks the top 80 sailing photographs from sailing regattas that year. Then, with the help of an international jury and a online public vote, the images are whittled down to a shortlist of 20, and finally to a single winner. \"I liked this image at first sight, and it deserves to win,\" says Jesus Renedo, a world-renowned professional photographer and member of the international jury. \"For us photographers, the most difficult thing is not to take a picture, but everything that leads to it. \"In Ricardo's case, I can only imagine that he had to convince the following boat driver and other passengers to get away from Scallywag when she arrived in Lisbon, in order to capture the boat's dark silhouette in the last rays of the sun, while still identifying her.  \"It is definitely a winning image, taken by a great photographer.\" Eloi Stichelbaut of France took the Yacht Racing Forum award, presented by the delegates of the Yacht Racing Forum, while Hungarian Brigi T\u00f6r\u00f6k won the public prize, with more than 10,000 votes counted.", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/tB1w1xR3kPA/index.html"}
