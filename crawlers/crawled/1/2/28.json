This new settlement between Grant and Mirror Group Newspapers, which owns the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, comes after the company admitted all three newspapers had hacked into his voicemails. \"This litigation has made clear that phone-hacking and other unlawful information-gathering took place on an industrial scale at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People,\" Grant said in a statement. A spokesman for Trinity Mirror plc, owner of Mirror Group Newspapers, said there would be no comment in response to the settlement agreement.

They wield an incredible power. They choose our governments, they choose our prime ministers and they live above the law.\"", "title": "Hugh Grant phone-hacking case against tabloid settled  - CNN"}
