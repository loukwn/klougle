There were kids playing football, fishermen, members of the military, a teacher and students in a classroom, and a firefighter lifting a child over his shoulder.   \"But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. That's the new definition of greatness,\" MLK can be heard saying. \"By giving that definition of greatness, it means that everybody can be great.

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which owns Ram, said in a statement that it \"worked closely with the representatives of the Martin Luther King Jr. estate to receive the necessary approvals and estate representatives were a very important part of the creative process every step of the way.\"   The automaker has often used message-driven Super Bowl ads with themes that touch on things like the economy and the farming industry.
