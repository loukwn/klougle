Benanti said she was moved to put together the album after \"seeing the images of children in cages.\"  All of the net proceeds from the album's sale will go to Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, better known as RAICES, and ASTEP (Artists Striving To End Poverty).  The album was produced by Benanti, Mary-Mitchell Campbell and Lynn Pinto. Featured songs include \"Arrorr\u00f3 Mi Ni\u00f1o\" (performed by Laura Benanti & Isabella Preston), \"Singing You Home\" (performed by Audra McDonald & Jason Robert Brown, who also wrote the song) and \"Cielito Lindo\" (performed by Lin Manuel-Miranda & Mandy Gonzalez)  On Twitter, Benanti, who frequently appears on \"The Late Show\" parodying First Late Melania Trump, said she has \"never been more proud of a project.\"  The album, out October 26, is available for pre-order.", "link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/lDRc24z7XBI/index.html"}
