Yellin shared some of Schumer's candidate recommendations for voters and directed followers to read to the bottom of a list where Schumer wrote, \"I'm pregnant.\"  Schumer, 37, teased the reveal in a separate Instagram post, sharing a photo of herself and her husband made to look like a pregnant Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. The couple married in an intimate outdoor ceremony in Malibu, California last February. Fischer is a James Beard award-winning chef and author. Beyond her work in film and television, Schumer is an advocate for equal rights and ending gun violence.
