Sources close to the family confirmed she was expecting to CNN in September.  \"My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world,\" Jenner said on Sunday. \"I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how.\" Jenner followed the Tweet with a video published to her YouTube channel showing intimate details of her life over the last last nine months.
