In June, Silverman talked about their long-distance relationship in an interview with ex-boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel on his late night show. \"I call him my on-again, off-again lover because we're apart by oceans,\" she said. \"One ocean. I'm not really sure.\" She explained that Sheen had stayed in the United States to be near his daughter Lily, but moved back to the United Kingdom once the 18-year-old headed off to college at New York University. \"And he really has a calling to -- you know how I'm like, kind of politically active,\" she said. \"Well he wants to be, and he needs to be home to do that, so he's there a lot. And then we just long for each other and we see each other and we love each other.\"", "title": "Sarah Silverman and Michael Sheen split - CNN"}
