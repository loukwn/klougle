{"title": "Manchester United to contest Jose Mourinho charge over Newcastle comments - BBC Sport", "description": "", "content": " Manchester United are \"vigorously contesting\" a Football Association charge against manager Jose Mourinho, for comments he made in Portuguese to a television camera after his side's win over Newcastle on 6 October. It is claimed he used \"abusive, insulting or improper language\" after the 3-2 comeback win at Old Trafford. Mourinho was given an extension until Wednesday to answer the charge. The Portuguese could face a possible touchline ban if found guilty. The FA used a lip reader and the 55-year-old's remarks were interpreted as offensive. Mourinho had been under pressure amid reports he would be sacked. His side had been 2-0 down to winless Newcastle at half-time of the Premier League game, but they scored three goals in the final 20 minutes to turn the match around.", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45973621"}
