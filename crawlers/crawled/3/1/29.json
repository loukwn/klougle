Ombudsman Services said it would no longer offer \"a broken solution to a broken market\". It is one of at least four services that offers redress in arguments between property agents - including estate agents - and individuals. It said it would complete its withdrawal by 6 August 2018. Other services operating in the housing market include The Property Ombudsman, The Property Redress Scheme and the Housing Ombudsman. \"Redress in the housing sector is a really confusing picture for all involved,\" said Lewis Shand Smith, the head of Ombudsman Services. \"The patchwork of alternative dispute resolution and ombudsman schemes is a mystery to consumers and therefore is incredibly difficult for them to navigate.\" The government is currently consulting on the creation of a single ombudsman to cover the whole of the housing market. Other sectors - like energy and finance - already have just one dispute resolution service. Property expert Henry Pryor said the present system was \"bonkers\", and the withdrawal of Ombudsman Services would be good news for consumers.", "title": "Ombudsman abandons 'broken' housing market - BBC News"}
